Down the street of tears
I think about the love we shared
Throughout our teenage years

Believe me, ooooooh, wah oooooooooh
Wah oooooooooh, believe me

Just because you said goodbye
Do you think that I will die
Just because you broke my heart
Now you thinking you're so smart

All the kids in town will know
They will know you hurt me so
Did you have to tell them all
That I still love you

I love you so
Can't let you go
(Believe me, believe me)
If you return
Love's flame will burn
(Believe me, believe me)

Just because you said goodbye
Do you think that I will die
Just because you broke my heart
Now you thinking you're so smart
All the kids in town will know
They will know you hurt me so
Did you have to tell them all
That I still love you-ooooooooooou
Oooooooooh wah ooooooooooh

With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing ev'ry song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to prey

I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before

My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more"

'Least I don't lie about that
Kind of comfort in you
Comes when you lie right back

Safe from such a strange point of view
To hear your own words on you

How much do you go to be gone?
You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in
Any way the wind blows in

Similar creatures we are
Chasing the pipe dream down
Love elusive so far
Keeps us divided now

Go, go on and write me love songs
So I have something to sing when your gone

How much do you go to be gone?
You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in
Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down
Do you know the way
To be in one place but sway?
Anyway the wind's blowin'

You are love, you are love
You are monsters and angels
Untouched, unseen

All in one, all in one
I take all that you are
'Cause you're just like me
But you move and it's hard
To stay close to a satellite

So I lose sight of you
Till you come round again
I'm watching the wind

Hey ay, hey ay, ay
Anyway the wind's blowin'
How much do you go to be gone?
You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down
Do you know the way
To be in one place but stay?
Any way the wind's blowin'
Any way the wind's blowin'"

Soon we found the perfect plan for love
Side by side we took a lovers walk
Word by word we had a lover's talk
One word led to another and then
Then in no time we're up to ten
My heart knew it was gonna end in love

1st step, a sweet hello
2nd step, my heart's aglow
3rd step, we had a date
4th step, we stayed up late
5th step, I walk you home
6th step, we're all alone
7th step, we took a chance
One kiss and true romance


Step by step we climbed to heaven's door
Step by step, each thrill invited more
Then you promised faithfully
All your love belonged to me
Now I know we'll always be in love
Step, step. Step, step. Step, step. Step step"

Pennies from heaven (from heaven)

Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven (from heaven)

You'll find your fortunes falling all over town
Make sure your umbrella is upside down (baby don’t you know)

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers

So when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

(Every time it rains, it rains)

A little dream castle with every dream gone
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay
Our beautiful garden has withered away
Where you planted roses the weeds seem to say
""A cottage for sale""

[Chorus]
From every single window
I see your face
But when I reach the window
There's an empty space

[Verse 3]
The key's in the mailbox, the same as before
But no one is waiting for me anymore
The end of our story is told on the door

Well, early one evenin' I was roamin' around
I was feelin' kind of mean, I shot a deputy down
Strolled along home, and I went to bed
Well, I laid my pistol up under my head

[Chorus]
(He strolled along home) I took my time
(And he went to bed) Thought I'd sleep some
(Laid his pistol) Big twenty-two

(Up under his head) I keep it handy

[Verse 2]
Well, early in mornin' 'bout the break of day
I figured it was time to make my getaway
Steppin' right along but I was steppin' too slow
Got surrounded by a sheriff down in Mexico

[Chorus]
(He was steppin' right along) I were hot-footin' it
(But he was steppin' too slow) It was a sultry day
(Got surrounded by a sheriff) Boxed in
(In Mexico) I didn't even have a chance to see the country

[Verse 3]
When I was arrested, well, I didn't have a dime
The sheriff said, ""Son, you're ridin' free this time
Where you're goin' you won't need a cent
'Cause the great state of Texas gonna pay your rent""
[Chorus]
(""'Cause where you're goin'"") I think he means jail
(""You won't need a cent"") Well, he knows I'm broke
(""'Cause the great state of Texas"") Yippee!
(""Gonna pay your rent"") I'm mighty grateful, fellas

[Verse 4]
Well, I didn't have a key, and I didn't have a file
Naturally I stayed around until my trial
Judge was an old man, ninety-three
And I didn't like the way the jury looked at me

[Chorus]
(Well, the judge was an old man) Too old
(Ninety-three) Entirely too old
I didn't like the way
The jury looked at me, I think they were suspicious

[Verse 5]
(The judge and the jury, they did agree)
(They all said, ""Murder in the first degree"")
(The judge said, same, ""I don't know whether to hang you or not
But this here killin' of deputy sheriffs has just naturally got to stop"")
You got a point there, judge!

[Verse 6]
It was a most unsatisfactory trial
They gave me ninety-nine years on the hard rock pile
Ninety and nine on the hard rock ground
All I ever did was shoot a deputy down
[Chorus]
(Ninety and nine) It could have been life
(On the hard rock pile) They might've hung me
(And all he ever did)
(Was shoot a deputy down) This whole thing has sure been a lesson to me

He sang right out from the bottom of his soles

Just commune with your innermost being
And, baby, you'll be just fine.""

I got a lucky penny and a mustard seed
But a warm and tender love is all I need

And I want a love that lingers
And a strong one through and through
So I'm gonna cross my fingers
That I'll find a boy who loves me true

But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through

There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket, it's true
But give a little listen to this, will you?

It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, jing, jing, jing

Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing

It ain't a turkey trot or a shimmy one step
But when grandma danced to it, she thought she was hep
It still is a ditty, I'm sure you will find
Will keep a-runnin' 'round and 'round your mind

Dame! Le ciel vous comblait:
Votre foulard de soie
Flottant sur vos épaules
Vous aviez le beau rôle
On aurait dit le roi...
Vous marchiez en vainqueur

Mon Dieu!... Qu'elle était belle...

Qu'il y ait un navire

Il emmenait avec lui
La douce aux yeux si tendres

Qu'elle brisait votre vie
L'amour, ça fait pleurer
Comme quoi l'existence
Ça vous donne toutes les chances
Pour les reprendre après...
Allez, venez, Milord!
Vous avez l'air d'un môme!

Je soigne les remords
Je chante la romance
Je chante les milords

My future held in store

So, remember
When you take my only treasure
Please, take good care of her
Take good care of her

I must accept it
She loves you more than me
So with my broken heart
I'll bow out gracefully

Please don't send me
Any wedding invitation
For I couldn't bear to see her there with you
If she's happy
That will be my consolation
So, take good care of her

If you love her
And she makes one mistake
Please don't leave her
It would make your heart ache
Take a fool's advice
Don't pay the price I had to pay

If you need her
But you're letting her go
Please don't do it
You'll be sorry, I know
Take a fool's advice
Don't pay the price I had to pay

Truly
She's caused you to doubt her
Truly
She's broken the rules
But life's not worth living without her
So listen to the wisdom of a fool

Think it over
And forgive her this time
I was foolish
I lost the love that was mine
Take a fool's advice
Don't pay the price I had to pay
Take a fool's advice

There in the moon mist

Never before were mine so strangely willing

What one embrace can do, look at me
It's got me loving you madly

I'm going home to no one
I'm going home alone

It was fun to be fancy free
But now my loneliness
Shows through, I miss you

What's the good in crying
I'm only wasting tears
What can I say, what can I do
It's just a house without you

We planned a home
High on a hill
Til I had the urge to roam
But now I found
No peace of mind
I can't seem to live alone

I think I'm gonna stop this crying
Yeah, I'm only wasting tears
What can I say, what can I do
It's a house without you
Just a house without you
Now we planned a home
High up on a hill
Til I had the urge to roam

Lord, I got to stop this crying
Cause I'm only wasting tears
Why should I fret
And go and grab a jet
Cause what am I rushing to

It's just a hole in
The wall without you
It ain't nothing there without you
It's like zero without you
Baby, ain't nothing there without you"

Pop goes the weasel

Ha ha, yeah

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Every night, when I go out
The weasel's on the table
Take a stick and knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Mix it up and make it nice
Pop goes the weasel
You know, pop goes the weasel
For years, I've wondered
What that meant
And nobody seemed to know

So, I looked it up
And the official explanation
Goes something like this

Pop goes the weasel refers to
The habit of London hatters long ago
Popping or pawning their weasels
Or accessories on Saturday night
To buy liquor, isn't that interesting? Haha

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

But you know
I've got a theory of my own
About pop goes the weasel
It's much simpler

Why did the weasel go pop, go pop?
Pop, pop goes the weasel
Why did the weasel go pop?
'Cause they upped the price
Of tuppeny rice to four pence
How did the pop get into the weasel
Weasel, pop goes the weasel
How did the pop get in there
Well, the weasel caught his
Beakle in the treacle

Now, if you've got a weasel
And you don't want him to pop
The next time you go shopping
Don't you take him in the shop
Two, three, four

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now that is the way
That the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Every night, when I go out
The weasel's sitting on the table
Now I take a stick
And I knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel
Together now

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now, I mix it up
And I make it nice
Pop, pop, pop goes the weasel

Pop, pop, pop goes the weasel
Poppity, poppity, pop
Goes the weasel now

Would you excuse me for a moment?
I'm just gonna pop my weasel, hahahaha"

""I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree""

[Chorus]
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat


[Verse 2]
One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky
We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me

[Chorus]
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat


[Verse 3]
One day she left without a word, she took away the sun
And in the dark she left behind I knew what she had done
She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true
A sadder man but wiser now I sing these words to you
[Chorus]
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

Ramble on, ramble on
When your ramblin' days are gone
Who will love you with a love true
When your ramblin' days are gone

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, Heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
(One more time, everybody, now)

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, Heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?"

I need somebody to be my baby
Someone to tell my troubles to
I got no time to ever find her

I travel around from town to lonely town
I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
If I find fortune and fame
And lots of people know my name
That won't mean a thing if I'm all alone

I got no rest when I'm feeling weary
I got to pack my bags and go
I got to be somewhere tomorrow
To smile and do my show

A lonely cell in which
An empty heart must dwell

What kind of lips are these?
That lied with every kiss
That whispered empty words of love
That left me alone like this

Why can't I fall in love?
Like any other man
And maybe then I'll know
What kind of fool I am

What kind of clown am I?
What do I know of life?
Why can't I cast away
This mask of play and live my life?

Why can't I fall in love?

Don't let it go too far

Darling that's what you are
I know I could never
Ever stop loving you
No man is an island
And I need you, honest I do
Every single day my love for you
Keeps growing more and more
The lips of an angel
Never kissed me before
And now that I've found you
I'll be counting on you
To love me forever
'Cause I need you, honest I do
It took an awful lot of looking to find you
Oh, what a time I've been through
'Cause darling it's not very easy
Finding an angel like you
The two of us together hand in hand
We stand at heaven's door
Together forever
I'll be yours evermore
Through all of my lifetime

(If I had to choose just one day)

If I had to choose just one day

It would surely be that Sunday
The day that I met you

Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills
Summer was a-coming in but fast
Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills
Nodding all together, I could almost hear them whisper
""Go on, kiss her, go on and kiss her""

If I had to choose one moment
To live within my heart
It would be that tender moment
Recalling how we started
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me
That way, that Sunday, that summer

Is there still a chance

No conocí el amor

Llegaste en mi soledad
Como un amanecer
Iluminando así
Mi corazón, todo mi ser

I'm in love with an angel
One who said, ""I love you so""
Heaven sent me an angel
And my angel is you

Let me tell you, I was sad and blue
With nothing else to do
Looking at the rain
On my window pane
Once you smiled at me
Then anyone could see
The rain was gone

[Puente]
I've never been so much in love
My heart can tell you so
I've never felt this way
But now I know, honest I do

I'm in love with an angel
And I know she's really real
Got a date with an angel
For the rest of my life

I'll never forget the sound that night
The crying tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

[Chorus]
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 2]
Well, when I woke up, the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running in my eyes
But I found my baby somehow that night
I raised her head and she smiled and said
""Hold me darling for a little while""
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life that night

[Chorus]
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

In a little café, just the other side of the border
She was, uh, sitting there givin' me looks that make my mouth water
So I started walking her way
She belonged to badman José
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave
Then I heard her say, ye-yeah

[Chorus]

""Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long""

So we started to dance, in my arms, she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist, uh, just one little kiss, so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say
""Vamos

And I knew, yes, I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, ye-yeah

And as I rode away
I could hear her say to José, ye-yeah

I can't wait to kiss you (oh no)
One little minute more

We met at a party last week
And the moment your eyes looked into mine
Right then I just forgot how to speak
And the soda started tastin' like wine

How I wished everyone would go home
So I could say when I got you alone

Come on now
Let's lock the door and throw away the key now
(shom dooby-dum dooby-dum-dum)
I can't wait to kiss you (oh no)
One little minute more

We started to talk and you smiled
Sorta like you knew the way that I felt
You moved a little closer in a while
Then I knew my heart was startin' to melt

There was just so much I wanted to say
But all the words came out this way
Come on now
Let's lock the door and throw away the key now
(shom dooby-dum dooby-dum-dum)
I can't wait to kiss you (oh no)

Ahhhhh no! Oh yeah
No! Oh yeah

I'll kiss your lips like a kiss oughta be
And then I know you'll be sayin' to me

Come on now

But until we do, all my best to you""

I need you my darling

He lives down there in his valley (Brussels sprouts)
The cat stands tall and green (spinach)
Well, he ain't no prize, and there's no women his size
And that's why the cat's so mean
One day he left His valley pad
I mean to say This cat was mad
Now listen 'round He wasn't gone long
And then he ran into an Amazon
Well, this changed his whole complexion (broccoli)
He had never seen such a beautiful sight (corn)

Well, he looked at her
And she looked at him
And she almost passed out from fright
He looked at her Thought, ""what a dilly""
He touched her once She slapped him silly
This was something He had never sensed
He looked at her As she commenced
Now listen, pal This ain't no fluke
I can't see goin' with a big green kook""

Where the music is fine and the lights are always low!
I know a place
Where we can go

At the door there's a man who will greet you
Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs
Soon, I'm sure, you'll be tapping your feet
Because the beat is the greatest there

All around there are girls and boys
It's a swingin' place
A cellar full of noise!
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
You gotta come along right now!
'Cause I tell you

The hour that the ship comes in

Oh the seas will split and the ship will hit
And the sand on the shoreline will be shakin'
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
And the mornin' will be breakin'!

Oh the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smilin'
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken'
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean

Oh a song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
And the sun will respect every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a touchin'
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'!
Of the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in


And they'll raise their hands sayin'
""We'll meet all your demands""
But we'll shout from the bow ""Your days are numbered!""
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
And like Goliath they'll be conquered!"

Look out your window and I'll be gone

And it ain't no use in a-turnin' on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road

But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me want to change my mind and stay
But we never did much talkin' anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore

I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin', walkin' down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long, honey baby
Where I'm bound I can't tell
And goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say ""fare thee well""

I ain't a-sayin' you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don't mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right"

You've changed a lot somehow
From the one I used to know
For when you hold me now
I feel like you never want to let me go

It's a sign of the times
That you call me up whenever you feel lonely
It's a sign of the times
That you tell your friends that I'm your one and only

I'll never understand
The way you treated me
But when I hold your hand
I know you couldn't be the way you used to be

Maybe my lucky star
At last decided to shine
Maybe somebody knows
How long I've waited to make you mine

Mm mm mm
I'll never understand
The way you treated me
But when I hold your hand
I know you couldn't be the way you used to be

Maybe my lucky star
At last decided to shine
Maybe somebody knows
How long I've waited to make you mine

It's a sign of the times
That you kiss me now as if you really mean it
It's a sign of the times
And a year ago I never could have seen it

Don't ever change your mind
And take your love away
Just leave the past behind

Stripped of my heart, my soul

I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars
Tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be
What now my love

No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die
What now my love
Now there is nothing
Only my last goodbye

When a woman loves a man
She’ll spend all of her time
Trying to hold on to what she needs
She'll give up all her comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If he says that’s the way it ought to be

Well this woman really loves you
I gave you everything I had
Try to hold on, to your unwelcome love
Baby please don't treat me bad

Deep down in her soul
He can bring her such misery
If he plays her for a fool
She’s the very last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

From the brim to the dregs

I met a girl with a pint in her purse
She was cute as two speckled puppies
And I said, ""Ben, you could do worse""

Walked across her table too
And I flopped myself down in a chair
And said, ""Hi there""
She whispered my name is Mabel
And all I could say was, ""Hi there""

I said, ""Permit me to introduce myself Ben Colder here""
She said, ""It ain't been no colder here than anyplace elsе""

I had her almost persuaded
What happеned to the doodle-doodle-do?
Thank you
To slip- strip herself of her pride
Almost persuaded
To slip me a drink on the side

[Verse 3]
Then we danced and we danced and we danced and we danced
That is I thought I was dancing 'til somebody stepped on my hand
Then I looked in her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band
And I thought, ""That sure is strange I ain't even married""
What it was it was my wrist watch
[Chorus]
I had her almost persuaded
Once more there Hargus
To come and be my own
Smart aleck

Put a flame in my heart

Remain in my heart

There lived a knight who
Wasn't quite as bold
As a knight should be

He rode an old grey mare called Bess
Searchin' for a damsel in distress
Just to see if he
Could set her free

See the knight in rusty armour ride
To her aid
Trusty sword is hanging at his side
With a rusty blade

Up the tower steps he sneaked
But as he moved
His rusty armour squeaked
Such a mournful note

And all the sentries at their posts
Thought it must have been the castle ghost
They jumped for their lives
In the moat

So the knight in rusty armour won
His fair maid
Had no need to draw his trusty sword
With a rusty blade
As he bent to kiss his bride
He found that he was rusted up inside
In his battle dress
And I can't guess

How they still got married and had twins
They came in tins
Every suit of armour ever made has a kink
Chainmail pants with a missing link"

Bernadette, people are searching for
The kind of love that we possessed (Bernadette)
Some go on searching their whole life through
And never find the love I've found in you

[Verse 1]
And when I speak of you, I see envy in other men's eyes
And I'm well aware of what's on their minds (Ah, don't you know?)
They pretend to be my friend
, when all the time (Sweet Bernadette)
They long to persuade you from my side (Sweet Bernadette)
They'd give the world and all they own
For just one moment we have known

[Chorus]
Bernadette, they want you because
Of the pride that it gives
But Bernadette, I want you because
I need you to live

[Verse 2]
But while I live only to hold you
Some other men, they long to control you (Ah, don't you know?)
But how can they control you, Bernadette? (Sweet Bernadette)
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette? (Sweet Bernadette)
From wanting you, needing you
[Chorus]
But darling, you belong to me (Bernadette)
I'll tell the world, you belong to me
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me (Bernadette)
I'll tell the world, you're a part of me
Bernadette

[Bridge]
In your arms, I find the kind of peace of mind
The world is searching for
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine
Has always been longing for

[Verse 3]
In you I have what other men long for
All men need someone to worship and adore (Ah, don't you know?)
That's why I treasure you and place you high above
(Sweet Bernadette)
For the only joy in life is to be loved (Sweet Bernadette)
So whatever you do, Bernadette

[Chorus]
Keep on loving me (Bernadette)
Bernadette, keep on needing me

There's something special about six o'clock
In the mornin' when it's still too early to knock
And the dusty light shines down on the block
And reflects up and down on the hands of the clock
Six o'clock, six o'clock

[Verse 1]
A few hours ago, she was standin' here
Just watchin' the stars in our eyes
And the lights as uptights disappear
And I could feel I could say what I want
That I could nudge her and call her my confidante
And now I'm back alone with just my shadow in front
At six o'clock, six o'clock

[Verse 2]
I went home and found that tryin' to sleep was a laugh
Just watchin' my eyelids, knowin' my brain
Bids the night not to pass
I got up and got scufflin' around
But somehow, it just wasn't the same happy town
And the bells didn't ring with the same happy sound
At six o'clock, six o'clock

[Bridge]
If I go back where we parted
Could I ever be like that again?
Guess I'll just have to wait 'til tomorrow
But what can I do 'til then?
[Verse 3]
Guess I'll go back home and just wait until dawn
Guess I had to learn goin' back
Where we were wouldn't help at all
And I wish my head had been workin' right
We'd have gone for coffee and talked all night
And now I'm back alone feelin' twisted up tight
Six o'clock, six o'clock

Now I'm back alone
Yes, now I'm back alone

Given me the courage and
Strength to go on and on
And for you, I sing this song

My pockets ain't filled with money
The old car I drive runs funny
And I don't have much to offer
A sweet fine girl like you

But here's my heart, please take it
You see, I need your love
If I'm gonna make it

Come on, take me
Oh, darling, take me
Take me, take me as I am
Just as I am
Now listen to this
Wilson Pickett found himself
Someone to love, Joe Tex did too
And Otis Redding said
I've tried and I've tried
He found someone to love

But I believe there's different
Strokes for different folks
And if you give your woman
What she wants when she wants it
How she wants it, where she wants it
And every time you think she wants it
You won't ever have to
Worry about anything

And that's why, darling, to you
I can stretch out my arms
Baby, I'm yours and yours alone

(Take me) take me, take me
(Take me) right now, right now
Just as I am, you got it, baby
I'm all yours, come on

Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Everybody, clap your hands one time

When love walked away from my heart

Something happens inside you

She hides in an attic concealed on a shelf
Behind volumes of literature based on herself
And runs across the pages like some tiny elf
Knowing that it's hard to find
Stuff way back in her mind
Winds up spending all of her time
Trying to memorize every line
Sweet Lorraine, ah sweet Lorraine

Sweet lady of death wants me to die
So she can come sit by my bedside and sigh
And wipe away the tears from all my friends eyes
Then softly she will explain
Just exactly who was to blame
For causing me to go insane
And finally blow out my brain
Sweet Lorraine, ah sweet Lorraine

Well you know that it's a shame and a pity
You were raised up in the city
And you never learned nothing 'bout country ways
Ah 'bout country ways

The joy of life she dresses in black
With celestial secrets engraved in her back
And her face keeps flashing that she's got the knack
But you know when you look into her eyes
All she's learned she's had to memorize
And the only way you'll ever get her high
Is to let her do her thing and then watch you die
Sweet Lorraine, ah sweet Lorraine
Now she's the one who gives us all those magical things
And reads us stories out of the I Ching
Then she passes out a whole new basket of rings
That when you put on your hand
Makes you one of the Angel Band
And gives you the power to be a man
But what it does for her you never quite understand
Sweet Lorraine, ah sweet Lorraine

Well you know that it's a shame and a pity
You were raised up in the city
And you never learned nothing 'bout country ways

At night the answers he may meet, umm, hmm
With sick and twisted minds he shares
The searching questions his heart bears, umm, hmm

Their way into his supple mind
In time the planted seeds will grow
Into a twisted vine below

Deprived of love and wrought by fear

Too much for me woman more than my heart could stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You been reckless with my heart
If I stay around you sure to tear it all apart

Said the road's got to end somewhere, oh
Every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the low down
We've come to the end of our road

[Verse 2]
Just think about all the nights you left me at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you know I loved you only
Runnin', 'round with every girl in town
I'm telling you boy no longer will I be your clown

Said the road's got to end somewhere
Said every road has got to end somewhere
Sick and tired of your stuff
Said enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
Whoa

No, no, no
Somewhere baby I just got to go

[Verse 3]
You made more sense when you begged and you pleaded
Talkin' 'bout I'm the one you're needing
Said I done had my fill of you
Hurt me some through the years
I just broke up running out of tears
Tell you I couldn't cry if I wanted to

[Chorus]
Said he road's got to end somewhere
Every roads got to end somewhere
Time and again I begged you to slow down
So I'm giving you the low down
We've come to the end of our road

In everything you say and do

Aww, take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry

Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky

If I'd been true
I know she'd never be with you

I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below don't bother me, no, no

So when I come home feeling tired and beat
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I'll get far away from the hustling crowd
And all the rat-race noise down in the street
On the roof, that's the only place I know
Look at the city, baby
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof
And at night the stars they put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
That's what I said
Keep on telling you
That right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's troubleproof
And if this old world starts a getting you down
There's room enough for two

I'm not tryin' to be no pimp
I just don't intend to work to hard
I won't have to buy the groceries
She gotta pay the rent
She gotta fill up my car every day
And give me account of every dime she spend

I made up my mind
If this is the way life has gotta be
I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me

She gotta make me think she loves me
By staying in her place
And sleep in another room
So she won't be snorin' in my face
And when I ask her for some money
To go out on the town
I want you to hand it to me smilin'
And don't you have no frown

I made up my mind baby
If this is the way life has gotta be
Yes I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me
Now when I ask for some money
To go out on the town
I want you to hand it to me smilin'
And don't you be no clown
Now that might sound cold to ya baby
You might think I'm unfair
But I've been hurt so many times
Till I, I really don't care

Don't say that this is the end!

It's time to face reality

It's only love that I feel inside
But I'll get by somehow
It's only love
I never woke up from my dream, girl
I know there's something else for me, girl

I tell myself that it's not real
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way
Tomorrow brings another day

It's only love that I feel inside
But I've got to be strong
Keep my mind hangin' on
It's only love but I know I'll get by
I'll take my heart and pride and just throw them aside

Or tear it down and start again

Said that I was bad for you
So, we'd meet on the other side of town

I got a feelin' way down in my heart
And that's the way that it's gonna be

But I love you now with every breath
And I believe I'll love you more after death
I give my love to you all my body and soul
I give my mind to you with a love that'll never grow old
You are the winter, girl you are the spring
You are the Bible, girl you are the ring
You are the lover you are the friend
You are the beginning, girl you are the end
I give my love to you all my body and soul
I give my mind to you with a love that'll never grow old"

Tripping over toys
And picking up socks
And you think her day
Had been a ton of trouble

She's been doing important things
With trading stamps
And turnip greens
And have I noticed how
The price of soap has doubled

She's as normal as she can be
She never misses Jeopardy
And I think that she'd elope
With Dick Van Dyke

And when the kids have all been fed
And when I lay me down to bed
She gives me my time of the night

Then she's a lover
She comes to my side
Right around midnight
After her day's been so confused
That's why I love her
And that's why I do right
And if there's a reason
God gave me a feeling
Baby, it's you

She hates tangerines
She loves the ring
Volunteers me for everything
And the bank has never
Been right in her life

She thinks my Uncle Bill's a sap
She's taught me words like overdraft
The only numbers she remembers
Is her shoe size

She had words with the guy next door
And almost started a neighborhood war
Cause he said something smart
To our son, Bob

And therefore, I had to invite him in
To apologize and convince him
She really didn't think he was
A big, fat slob
She's as normal as she can be
She never misses Jeopardy
And I think that she'd elope
With Dick Van Dyke

You used to walk with me
And every step I take recalls
How much in love, we used to be

Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love you, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

When shadows fall, I pass a small cafe
Where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it
Felt to kiss and hold you tight

Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love you, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

If you should find you miss the sweet
And tender love we used to share
Just go back to the places where we used to go
And I'll be there
Oh, how can I forget you

Always something there to remind me

We'll catch the sun, and away we'll fly

Are you ready not to be alone?

And if you're ready, then he'll carry you home
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

People say that he won't come
And I don't know what say you
But if he should, would you be the one?
I've got a little question I'd like to ask you

It scares me sometimes when I see just how you got away

It seems to work fine and I really don't know why I stay

You buy two and it costs less

The many roads I've covered
The many trails I've burned
But when our paths did cross, love, oooh
My whole world made a turn

[Chorus]
And we've got time to kill, what a thrill
June and July
We've got all our love, buckets of
The tears that we've cried
Now we don't cry no more, gonna bolt the door
Don't know what we got, but it feels like a lot
We don't need no more

[Verse 2]
When my day's work is done
We can take in a jamboree
But I just wanna sit down by the fire
With my love right here beside me

[Chorus]
We've got time to kill, Catskill
Sweet by and by
We got all our love, the sky above
The twinkle in your eye
Now where the wheel might roll is where my love and I shall go
We're gonna plant the seed, there ain't nothing we need
We found our own rainbow
[Verse 3]
My love wants to have her fortune read
And I know that she's in a hurry
If we go along the straight and narrow
You don't even have to worry

[Chorus]
We've got time to kill, standin' still
Go on, give it a try
We've got all our love, mountains of
The trees are so high
We don't need no big car, don't eat no caviar
When we come to rest, we take to the nest
You know where we are"

Close to the door

I walk the floor

Why don't you all lend a helpin' hand?
Instead of shoutin’ and screamin'
Let's plan instead of dreamin'
So the world will understand, stop this

Tryna run all over me
Bad water, bad water
Tell me why won't you set me free?

Tryna run all over me"

Winter froze the river
And winter birds don't sing
So winter makes you shiver
So time is gonna bring you spring
So he swears he'll never marry
Says that cuddles are a curse
Just tell him plain
You're on the next train
If love don't get there first

[Chorus]
Time and love, everybody
Time and love (Oh, time and love)
Nothing cures like time and love
Don't let the devil fool you
Here comes a dove
Nothing cures like time and love
(Nothing cures like time and love)

[Verse 2]
Winter froze the river
And winter birds don't sing
So winter makes you shiver
So time is gonna bring you spring
You've been running
You've been rambling
And you don't know what to do
A holy golden wager says
That love will see you through
[Chorus]
Time and love, everybody
Time and love (Oh, time and love)
Nothing cures like time and love
Don't let the devil fool you
Here comes a dove
Nothing cures like time and love

Jesus was an angel
And mankind broke His wing
But Jesus gave His lifeline
So sacred bells could sing
Now a woman is a fighter
Gathered white or African
A woman is a woman inside
Has miracles for man at night

Time and love, everybody
Time and love (Oh, time and love)
Nothing cures like time and love
Don't let the devil fool you
Here comes a dove
Nothing cures like time and love

I think of you
And suddenly my pillow is your face and your arms
And when the winter wind comes chasin' after me
I think of you
And it's as though I crawl beneath the blanket
Soft and warm

How did I get from dark to daylight
Before you happened to pass by?
How did I find my way through life
Before you brightened up my sky?
Was there a sky at all
Until you painted it for me?
How did I get on
'Til you came along?

Who knows how many times I pause in every day
To think of you?
As often as the sun sails out upon the silent sea!
And if you're wonderin' why it is I only think of you
Well it's because I'd like to be as close to you
As you've become to me!
I think of you

Headed up to Crete, Nebraska
Trying my best to set the highway on fire
But my bicycle won't go no faster

Tarkio Road is a mother
It's just like oh so many others
Well, the children reject you
And the police inspect you
Looking inside the trunk
Under the hood, hoping to find
The secret places where you
Always keep your mind
Whoa-oh-no, Tarkio Road

Abbie and Rubin lyin' in jail
Learning about the price of bein' free
Trying to live the Constitutional life
And being held back by hypocrisy
Carry the load, my brother
You're just like oh so many others
Ooh, the children reject it
And the police inspect it
You're tied to the chair
Better cool it, bound and gagged
Is that the ways on the American flag
Whoa-oh-no, carry the load

Twenty-four hours of barbed wire fence
Fifty-five years of pollution
Everyone knows how the puzzle was laid
But can anyone recall the solution
Tarkio Road is a mother
It's just like oh so many others
Where the people infect you
But they never elect you
No reason of cause that you may have perfectly sound
The blind looker's gonna try and cut it down

And I spent some time in jail
But then my face turned pale and my health it started to fail
So the sheriff he let me go
And then the townspeople caught me and they ran me out of town on a rail
Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home

Mare carry me
Take me back down to the place where I want to be
Cause home's where I should go
And I never want to travel that god-forsaken trail no more

How hard it is to be free
From wearing masks that turn to skin
Hiding what you could have been

And I, I, I'm so confused
Which way, which way to choose?
Ride with me baby 'til the end of the day

Mama's home philosophy
Makes everyone a freak but me
Though I'm starvin' in the streets
And can't predict the future
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the sanest of us all?
Is he with me or one of them?
How does he dress, who are his friends?

Mama's home philosophy
Makes everyone a freak but me

Until I come together

How the world could get younger
When all the rockets go upwards
And living values go downwards
People messing up the planet
Wrecking city and hamlet
Wondering how they choose to plan it
It's such a crazy fast pace with the turn of a face

Well people we've got a dream
And it's a beautiful dream
That the longing to live
With the people that give
That's the right way to live
So be good to each other
Like everybody is your brother
Like you've got the same mother
And the world is your home

Keep the family living
And by your friends you'll be giving
For your share of the earnings
Make the best of your learnings
And what you'll find is a good life
Simple cares for the bad strife
Ain't no reason for a sad life
You know we're really the same
And everybody's to blame
Well people we've got a dream
And it's a beautiful dream
That the longing to live
With the people that give
That's the right way to live
So be good to each other
Like everybody is your brother
Like you've got the same mother
And the world is your home

Cause on the average sidewalk
It's full of fighting and mean talk
And the world is a false order
You know it's always the same
People looking for freedom
From the west to the east rung
But when they know they can get it
Or if they should really try
Makes a man want to cry

Cause we'll give you our last cry
And if we have to our last night
But if our brothers won't shed it
It would do us no better
But what use is our token
Lord if our bodies get broken
Then the message ain't spoken
And we'd have done it all wrong
So we're singing this song
Well people we've got a dream
And it's a beautiful dream
That the longing to live
With the people that give
That's the right way to live
So be good to each other
Like everybody is your brother
Like you've got the same mother
And the world is your home

Well people we've got a dream
And it's a beautiful dream
That the longing to live

You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody (listen to the melody) cause my love's in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine (you are a friend of mine)

It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

[Verse 1]
It's five o'clock in the morning
I'm just getting in, I knock on the door (Knock, knock, knock)
A voice sweet and low says (Who is it?)
She opened up the door and let me in (Let me in)
Never once does she say, where have you been?
She says (Are you hungry?)
Are you hungry, honey? Did you eat yet?
Let me hang up your coat
The woman tells me, pass me your hat
All the time she smiles, never raises her voice
It's five o'clock in the morning
And I don't give it a second thought

[Chorus]
It's a thin line between love and hate
Don't think you can keep breakin' your woman's heart
It's a thin line between love and hate
An' she'll sit back an' enjoy it
It's a thin line between love and hate (Yes, it is, yes, it is)
(She gon' fool you one day)
[Bridge]
The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way, you keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That really really hurt you one day

[Verse 2]
Here I am laying in the hospital
Bandaged from feet to head
In a state of shock (That much)
Just that much from being dead
I didn't think my woman could do something like this to me
I didn't think she had the nerve, here I am
I guess action speaks louder than words

[Chorus]
It's a thin line between love and hate
Don't think you can keep treatin' your woman bad
It's a thin line between love and hate
An' she won't ever get mad
It's a thin line between love and hate (Yes, is is)
She's gonna fool you one day
It's a thin line between love and hate
Every smilin' face ain't a happy one"

I always knew about the son of evil - could lead a woman to no good...
Mm-hmm...

He used to get me from the church window, telling me I wouldn't be missed
Promising we'd just hold hands, and maybe just one little kiss...

While I wait at bars and grills, commercial love, commercial thrill...
But I remember the righteous living, and doing all I knew for good;
If I could change this corruption, you know I would if I only could...

If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race

When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all

It's got overdrive, just won't stall

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost

It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared

The brakes are good, tires fair

Pulled out of San Pedro
late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill

Passing cars like they was standing still

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see
Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive


Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck
Crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by
Now all of a sudden she started to knockin'

And down in the dips she started to rockin'
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'

The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail
And called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!"""

Seems to say
There must be
Another way

Would you say
That the world is greener now than it was yesterday
If we stay in a world that's been abused in almost every way
How can we go to say
We are free

Where are all the men of learning
Have we lost the chance of learning
History or
???
Tell me where are all men of vision
Some must have made provision for the human race
On the face of the earth

Gas back into air

Laughing and a running hey, hey skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with our hearts a thumpin' and you

Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mind with a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding all along the water fall, with you
My brown eyed girl, you my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Ha la la la la la la dee da
Ha la la la la la la dee da
Laa dee da

Oh, in a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off

In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
""My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home""

As I did on my own

[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally


[Verse 2]
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, well who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play

But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?

I truly am indeed
[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Bridge]
It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?


[Classical Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Verse 3]
Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken

Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

I'll put you above me

Friends are like warm clothes
In the night air, best when they're old
And we miss them the most when they're gone
Miss them the most when they're gone
Your friends love your good side
And live with your bad
But they want you and need you
When no one else knows you're alive

Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond
If you held it in your hand

Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

You been tellin' me you're a genius
Since you were seventeen
In all the time I've known you
I still don't know what you mean

The weekend at the college
Didn't turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge
I can't understand

Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?

And I spent a lot of time

You find another man

The things you think are useless
I can't understand

Well, he specializes in talkin' trash
Carries himself like the world's biggest spender
But he ain't never got no cash
The clothes he wears are second to none
He's a Jack of all trades and a master of none
Agrees with everything he knows nothin' about
So he doesn't feel left out
Secondary all the things in life he really wants
Being in is his thing
So he's got to keep up his front

Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Trvin' to get over any way he can

He's a, he's a, he's a self-preservationist, yes he is
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
And a super-conversationalist, yes he is
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, he always borrows, never lends
He says, ""Get off me, man! I'm with him, let me in!""
Says he's willing to stick through thick and thin
But when the chips are down
People find him if you can
(Plastic man)
Claim to fame he has none
Friends in this world, maybe one
He hates being just another face in the crowd
Giving another brother five and talkin' loud

Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can

I guess you know he does a little, uh, dippin' and dabbin'
In a game they call backstabbin' (Plastic man)
You better stop your fantasizin'
And start, buh-buh-boom-boom, to realizin' that
Black is black and white is white
Wrong is wrong, hey, and right is right

Where the worst is best reported

There maybe girls that I'll remember
That made me happy for a while
But none of them compare with you my love
However hard they they all may try

If the bus that we're taking
Has for ages kept us waiting
What does it matter
Even in a queue
Happiness is me and you

There may be days when you discover
I'm not the man you think I am
But through it all we will recover
Without the aid of any plan
When the weeks turn to hours
And in June it's April showers
I'll tell you something I believe is true
Happiness is me and you

THE SEALS & CROFTS COLLECTION (1979)

When I was 17, I dreamed of being king. And having everything I wanted
But that was long ago and my dreams did not unfold, so I'm still the King of Nothing
When I was 17, I dreamed I gave a ring to a pretty queen and then I held her
But that was slumber's fault for I have no love at all. And I'm still the King of Nothing

If I could rule, I'd dance my cares away, find romance everyday
I wouldn't have to listen to this poor fool say
""I'm the King, I'm the King, I'm the King of Nothing."""

I just can't play a part
There's the need to be true to myself
And make my own mistakes
And not to lean too hard on someone else
No matter what it takes

So if you're sure it's love
Just be sure it's love

'Cause I am what I am and
I have the need to be

I'm not fool enough to ever think
That I could be the master of my fate
But it's up to me to choose my roads in life
Rocky may well be the ones I take
There's the need to be something more than
Just a reflection of a man
I can't survive in someone's shadow
I need my own spot to stand

The tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun that was floating on the breeze
Look at mother nature on the run in the nineteen-seventies
I was lying in a burned out basement with a full moon in my eyes
I was hoping for a replacement when the sun burst through the skies
There was a band playing in my head and I felt like getting high
I was thinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie
Well I dreamed i saw the silver spaceships flying in the yellow haze of
The sun
There were children crying and colors flying all around the chosen one
All in a dream, all in a dream the loading had begun
They were flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun"

The road was often paved with tears and pain
Whenever I got lost you were always there
Through it all you never once complained

There were times I know you thought
The sun would never find us
Sometimes I felt that same way too
Now it looks as if all the hard times are behind us
One by one our dreams are coming true
(One by one, one by one)

Love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love finds its own way
It needs no guiding light

Whoa, oh, it only needs two people
With a dream and endless faith
And given time and a little patience
Love finds its own way

I know you must have pushed aside your feelings
When down inside you thought you'd fall apart
And if it hadn't been for your believin'
We might still be stumblin' in the dark
Now we're standing on the threshold of a new beginning
The doors of life are opened wide
For once in our lives we're finally winnin'
All because love is on our side

Love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love finds its own way
It needs no guiding light

Because love, love finds its own way
Through the darkest night

You can see my life begin and end. I'll always play for you

And let this night go on forever, and don't you ever stop the music. Let your spirit set you free
Hear the band, hear the band. You can sing and stomp you feet and clap your hands
And these few moments we'll share together, and I'll play for you

I've practiced many years and I have come a long, long way just to play for you
My life is but a song that I have written in many ways, just to say to you
To say, I love you yes I do. And I'd like for you to be
Whatever you would like to be. You'll always be special to me

Hey, you know, everybody's talkin' about the good old days, right
Everybody, the good old days, the good old days
Well, let's talk about the good old days
Come to think of it as, as bad as we think they are
These will become the good old days for our children, hum
Why don't we, ah

[Verse 1]
Try to remember that kind of September, when
When life was slow and oh, so mellow, hum
Try to remember, and if you remember then follow

Oh, why does it seem the past is always better
We look back and think
The winters were warmer
The grass was greener
The skies were bluer
And smiles were bright

[Verse 2]
Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me
Would we
Could we
Memories, like the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Hahaa...

Oh, can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me.. haha...
Would we
Could we

Memories, may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The Way We Were...
Remember, the way we were"

I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life for you
I will go where you lead always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure enough, that's enough
You're all
You're all I need to get by

Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal

Cause we, we got the right foundation

You're all I want to strive for and do a little more

Inspiration's got a hold on me
And I don't want to be set free

It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you

You're a party with the lights down low
You're my Friday night movie show
Love me tender on the radio
Just hold me tight and don't let go

It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you

People fall in love and
All too soon it fades away
But, sweet darling, we won't fade
I will travel with you on down the line

It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace

Trying to find - the meaning of life today

But nothing to write home about

Were back in the alley tradin hands
Long came Wild Billy with his friend
G-Man all duded up for Saturday night

Well, Billy slammed on his coaster brakes
And said, ""anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake?""
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
I got a bottle of Rose, so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe
And I'll take you all out to where the Gypsy angels go
They're built like light and they dance like spirits in the night


(All night) in the night (all night)
Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (all night)
In the night (all night)
Stand right up now and let them shoot through you

Well now, Wild Billy was a crazy cat
And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap

He said, ""trust some of this, it'll show you where it's at
Or at least it'll really help you feel it""

By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
I had my head out the window
And Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt."" She said, ""Honey, let me heal it.""

And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night
(All night) in the night (all night)
Janey don't know what she do to you
Spirit in the night (all night) in the night (all night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me

Now the night was bright and the stars
Threw light on Billy and Davy dancin in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now, Hazy Davy got really hurt
He ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and crazy Janey was makin love in the dirt
Singin our birthday song
Janey said it ws time to go so we closed our eyes
And said goodbye to Gypsy Angel Row
Felt so right together we moved like spirits in the night (all night)"

When I meet a guy who is lovely as you
Ain't it funny, babe, what a little love can do? (Ain't it kind of funny?)
It is better than that poison, it's so stronger, stronger than glue

[Outro]
My love, ain't it, ain't it, ain't it kind of, ain't it kind of funny?

And oh, baby, baby, can't you see? I need you to love me
And always be by my side"

Yes, I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone

I don't think I can pretend, no
'Cause baby, you're more than just a friend
We grew up together, living separate lives
Now, we need each other, what a big surprise

I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone
Yes, I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone

Love you, love you
Love you, love you alone

I believe in karma and I believe in you
And I feel somehow you believe in me too

Suddenly arrives

Scattered in the wind

Easier to say

And so sad the song
Of just remembering when
Knowing the love of your our life
Will never come again

So sad the song
That says goodbye

We belong together
And now that you are
Of that you can rely
So would it be wrong
To give our love
Just one more try

Revved up like a deuce,
another runner in the night

Revved up like a deuce,

Blinded by the light

[Verse 1]
Madman, drummers, bummers
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat

In the dumps with the mumps

As the adolescent pumps his way into his hat

With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older

I tripped the merry-go-round

With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'

The calliope
crashed to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
The calliope crashed to the ground!

Some silicone sister
with a manager mister

Told me I got what it takes
She said, ""I'll turn you on, son, into something strong
Play the song with the funky break""

And go-kart Mozart
was checkin' out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside

And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly

And asked me if I needed a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Asked me if I needed a ride!

But, she was
blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

She's gonna make it through the night
She's gonna make it through the night

But mama, that's where the fun is

But mama, that's where the fun is

[Verse 3]
Some brimstone, baritone, anticyclone, rolling stone
Preacher from the east

Says, ""Dethrone the dictaphone
, hit it in it's funny bone
That's where they expect it least""
And some new-mown chaperone
was standin' in the corner
Watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone

Was messin' with his frozen zone reminding him of romance

Your arms to comfort me

No touch can do as half as much

To look back on

She makes it so nice to belong
Well
Makes a man's home a castle
And his life a song

Oh we fall
All I got I still need a way
To reach for things I swear I don't have today
I need to be what I'm not
All the time All the time All the time

My life has just been a masquerade
I swear a part I wish I wished I had never played
When will I learn that every dream
Can't be mine
Can't be mine

For the freedom that I lost
Cause I found out what's been missing
And I'm glad to pay the cost
Now that I've tasted you
I know nobody else would ever do
I'm glad that I can say you're mine

Sometimes you take me by surprise
And I don't know what to say
When I'm not alone
You always find me where I lay
When you call my name and take my breath away
It's uncanny baby, it's uncanny baby
Please don't you know, girl

When I was lonely, you were my friend
When I needed you, you took me in girl
When I was crazy, you bring me back home
When I see you, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love again
It's hard to talk about all the trouble that I feel
And I can't always see what's fantasy
What's real
But when you call my name
The worries disappear
It's uncanny baby, uncanny baby
You keep on doin' it girl
You do it to me, you do it to me
When I think about you don't you know
I hear that doorbell ringing in my ear
You do it to me, you do it to me
Your love's so good and interesting
Shows no sign of ending
Just keeps on taking me higher
Uncanny baby, uncanny baby, please girl
Uncanny baby, you know it's uncanny
You know it's uncanny you know it's uncanny now
Every time, every time I think about you
You know it's uncanny
Oh you always come through girl
You know it's uncanny, you know it's uncanny baby
Keep on doin' it girl
You know it's uncanny
Keep on keep on doin' it doin' it doin' it doin' it doin' it doin' it doin' it girl
You know it's uncanny
Keep on keep on"

Really reaching out for the other side
I may be climbing on rainbows, but baby, here goes
(Here we, here we go)

Dreams are for those who sleep, life is for us to keep
And if you're wond'ring what this song is leading to

I want to make it with you
(I really think that we can make it, girl)
I said I want to make it with you you, baby
I want to make it, I got to make it
Hey, I want to make it with you, baby
Because we belong together (yes we do, I know we can)
Oh, we can make it, girl

No, you don't know me well
Every little thing, only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do then we'll see it through

Life can be short or long, love can be right or wrong
If I choose the one I'd like to see me through

I want to make it with you
(I really think that we can make it, girl)
Said I want to make it with you, baby
I want to make it with you, baby
I want to make it with you, girl
I want to make it, wanna make it with you, baby
Said we belong together (Yes, we do)
We are going to be so happy, baby (I know we can)
I know we can, I know we can
Dreams they're for those who sleep, life is for us to keep
If you believe the things that I do
We're gonna see it through

Life can be short or long, love can be right or wrong

I want to make it with you

I really want to make it with you, girl
(I really think that we can make it)
(I really think that we can make it, girl)

I said I need, I need your love

I'm gonna lock you into my love

Pushing at her clothes
Dancing up a sweat now
And I wonder if she knows
That I want her so bad I'm in physical pain

Ended up making love
That's what I'm thinking of
Started out dancing
Ended up making love

Working to the rhythm
Looking in her eyes
Trying to send a message
Getting some replies
Feels like she's looking into my soul
Gotta look away just to keep control

Started out dancing
Ended up making love
That's what I'm thinking of
Started out dancing
Ended up making love
I wonder
Did she come alone
I wonder
Could I take her home
I wonder if she's looking for
Just a dance or a little bit more

Two us alone now

Doing what we feel
(Pushing at her clothes)
Dancing close together

I can't believe it's real

While I was wanting you
It's sure good luck when a dream comes true

You might even hang up the phone
But you see
It really doesn't make any difference
And it's only fair that I let you know
That that man that you've been seeing
He's mine, and I love him
So woman to woman, I think you'll understand

Woman to woman
That you can't take him from me

With the sun never shining on me
Sad and lonely but then when she came
She was all that I wanted to see

I want you to be mine
All I need is the words and the rhyme
I want you to be mine

Still I wonder how some things can suddenly change
And yet stay the same
I could never have thought life would lead me this way
The image I see
Is that really me
To need you more each and every day?

She was looking like handwoven dreams
In her eyes I saw oceans of pearls
There she was, I felt lost it seemed
I could only be thinking of her

Want you to be mine
All I need is a little more time
Want you to be mine

Still I wonder how some things can suddenly change
And yet stay the same
I could never have thought life would lead me this way

Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more
Oh my Lord, when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord, a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord, they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord, they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord, but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us (So praise the lord)

Of the Jungle

In a bungalow
While monkeys play above-a
We'll make love-a

Trigger my imagination

Love has a strange way of finding out
Everything in your heart
Strangest of all is you never know
Just what it is that's tearing you apart
Seasons may pass, summers come and go
Dreams flashing through your mind
Love is something that you dream about
Something that you left behind
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Time has a strange way of reaching out
The years turn to yesterday
Reach out a hand, try to grab the past
Stop it all slipping away
Happens to you almost anywhere
A flash before the storm
Just reach out a hand, try to touch her face
Only to find she is gone
Just like I told you again
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Never known love burn so bright
Little girl could have been so right
We could have been so happy
I won't be there
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Love has a strange way of turning round
When happiness turns to pain
Something that you thought you had has gone
And somehow things will never be the same
That hurt gets so bad as the days go by
A hurt that no drug can cure
There's only one thing that can satisfy
There's only one thing I'm longing for
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting

As a man passed by and asked us
What we were doing, what we need
As he pointed his big fat finger
To the people hanging round at the corner of the
Other side of street

So we had to hit him to the ground
Doing nothing, just hanging around

Because I've never been in love
Never been in love

Never been in love

Never been in love

I've never been in love like this before

Oh - what did I miss before

Well
This good luck
It's breaking out of bounds
And I just got to tell it
Tell it
Tell it
Oh scream and shout
Well you came like a hurricane
And sent me into the clouds
Oh and I haven't seen my feet for days
'Cause I'm miles above the ground

Because I've never been in love...

Well who says I need a doctor
'Cause I'm a second-hand crazed
I've been laughing so much

Oh they want to put me away
And I'm really gonna take these chains
Of off my life 'cause this lightening I know
I would never ever strike twice"

Maybe I’ll see you again, baby, and maybe I won’t
Maybe you bought your ticket gone back to Detroit
Aeroplanes make strangers of us all
Give us distance, much too easily
Jim says, “Some destinies should not be delivered”

But you and I see now, baby, that still they are
Winning it makes losers of us all
’Cause the dice roll, so indifferently

Well, I’ll wrap myself in cities I travel
I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in solitude
But I wish I could wrap myself in thee

Winter will come along driven by snow

I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in solitude

No more procrastinating
For this is the moment that was meant for me
And I'm moving like a wave on the ocean
Drifting to the opposite ride
Traveling with no destination
Just riding the tide

[Verse 2]
People they say that I'm foolish
They say that I'm living in a fantasy
I say, everything's easy
It's better than living in futility
So, I'm standing here in back of the curtain
Waiting for the start of the show
Acting like an actor is easy
If you can let go

Someday something will find you
A magical feeling you could not foresee
A feeling so devastating
From that moment on your life's a comedy
And suddenly you're light as a feather

The things you thought you needed are fading
Your reason to be
Your reason to be
Your reason to be

I think about you day and night
It's only right

To think about the one you love

So happy together

Invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
You'd ease my mind

Imagine how the world
Could be so very fine
So happy together

I can't see me
Loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're near me
Baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they
Toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

If I should call you up
Invest a dime
And you say you belong to me

It's hard to make love to a lady
When she's munching on a candy bar

And I couldn't help but say:
""Ain't no time for Milky-Way""
And she goes:
""I get off on it
I get off on it
Give just a little slack
Can't you see I'm into snacks
I get off on it""

There was a pretty thing in Los Angeles
But she was a man in women's clothes
I told him he was dressing kinda dangerous
'cause how's a fool like me gonna know

And I couldn't help but say:
""Why you wanna dress that way""
And he goes:
""I get off on it
I get off on it
Ain't no sweat off your nose
I just dig 'em ladies clothes
I get off on it""
Good old boy he met a girl and liked her
But she didn't know what he was all about
'cause when he filled his lip with tobacco
Don't you know it nearly grossed her out

And she couldn't help but say:
""Why you wanna do that way""
And he goes:
""I get off on it
I get off on it
I don't mean to make you flip
But don't be messin' with my dip
I get off on it""

There is a dude up in New York City
He wears nothing but a raincoat and he walks around
He comes up on to a lady looking pretty
And he gives her just glimpse from the waist down

And she couldn't help but say:
""Why you wanna act that way""
And he goes:
""I get off on it
I get off on it
I don't mean to bring you down
But I just gotta flash around""
There was a girl I had a lot of fun with
'Til she asked me to her house one night
And when she told me she was into bondage
Well don't you know it nearly blew my mind

Far apart, so together is destiny wedded

We're alone
on the beach for the passionate scene

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

I'm bored and alone and it's weakening me

In the right kind of place, in a time of need

I pick up on the thoughts that you're sending to me
And I wait for the day I hear you saying to me

Does your heart ever long for those days when love was true
Seems like that magic of yesterday has just slipped away
So my darlin', before you go
Oh, I hope you know

I'm gonna cry just a little, I'll die just a little
'Cause I still love you and I'll always love you
Cry just a little, I'll die just a little
'Cause I still love you and I'll always love you
I still remember when

We used to laugh at the silly things that we used to say
Now the song that I sing to you just turns you away
I never knew lovers could turn into strangers over night
How could I be so blind to the danger
Oh, it's just not right

I'm gonna cry just a little, die just a little
'Cause I still love you and I'll always love you
Cry just a little, I'll die just a little
'Cause I still love you and I'll always love you

I'm gonna have to cry just a little, or die just a little

You can be a pilot

But first, be a woman, ooh ooh...
When you're walking down the street
Show your feminine appeal
Even tho' you're wearing jeans
It's important to be real
You were born to be yourself
So no matter how you feel
If you want to impress the opposite sex
When he takes you for a ride
Let him open you the door
When he asks you for a dance
Let him lead you to the floor
When he kisses you good night
You just leave him wanting more
You can do all you can
Say I am what I am
But first be a woman... oh oh oh oh
When he takes you out to dine
Don't you end up in his bed
Wedding bells will ring in time
Make him dream of you instead
And his passion can be like
All the stories that you've read
He can be Romeo if you act like Juliet
Nowadays it ends too soon
Even tho' it's just begun
You can take him to the moon
He'll leave with the morning sun
So take a lesson from the past
Make him want and make him run...
(You can't be a quarterback
He can't wear a pretty dress
You cannot be Superman
And he's not a shy princess
So why try to be alike
When it's only self defense ?
You've got grace, he's got style
And together you'll rhyme
So remember to be true
To the legend that you are
All the feminine in you
Has worked miracles so far
So head up high and don't be shy
You can reach for any star
You can do all you can...
Say I am what I am
You can be an executive
Hhh ! You can drive a train
You can be a detective..."

I was tired of singin' the same old tune for so long
You rewrote the melody.. now it feels just right for me

... comin' over me
... I have finally found a feel for love
With just a touch of your love baby I feel it come again

Now I've finally found ya and our love's a growin' strong
Our love's a simple chorus just as words are to a song
Now you're lyin' next to me right where you belong
When I hold you close to me girl it feels just right for me

I... I can't stop this feelin'
... comin' over me

With just a touch of your love baby I feel it come again

Here it comes again

Can you feel it like I do
Can you feel it baby
I have never loved anyone like this before
Just a touch of your love baby brings me back for more

Looking for a light

And some people standing still
Some hold their hand out
And some people never will

Lovers and liars
Consumed by the fires
Of too many dances
But not enough song, you're my song

We pity the poor one
The shy and unsure one
Who wanted it perfect
But waited too long
There's no way to count
Or to measure the cost
Of the innocence lost
On the way to the sky
You and I
And we are two
And two of us are one
But maybe two of us
Can be enough to get it done

Consumed by the fires
Of too many dances

Much too long

What's he trying to put you through

Touched him with your sweet caress

And you're never gonna find another somebody like me

I've given you and that's what you believe
But I owe you the sunlight in the morning
And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away
And I owe you more than life now, more than ever
I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay
I'm amazed when you say it's me you live for
You know that when I'm holding you you're right where you belong
And my love, I can't help but smile with wonder
When you tell me all I've done for you 'Cause I've known all
Along. But I owe you the sunlight in the morning
And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away
And I owe you more than life now, more than ever

Testing me with your lies
And I was trying to play it down as I walked you home
Testing a new disguise

Then suddenly we're outside your home
Two rooms and a private door
And you turned to me
And you said:

Fade away
How could your eyes have been so wrong?
Fade away
Fade away into the night
How could your eyes have been so wrong?
Fade away

So I'm a lover without love [?]
Wondering what went wrong
Should I have tried a different role as a Romeo
And played the part out more strong?

Then I hear a sound coming from a doorway
Someone strikes a familiar tone
And the word begins
And she said:
Fade away
How could your eyes have been so wrong?
Fade away
Fade away into the night
How could your eyes have been so wrong?
Fade away

And I hear a sound coming from a doorway
Someone strikes a familiar tone

Fade away

Fade away
Fade away into the night
How could your eyes have been so wrong?

Enough of users and all them two time losers

So I'm gonna move out on the highway
Head on down the road leaving it all behind
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time
Living on the edge. Running with the wind
Soaring to the heights on an eagle's wing

If you wanna see your spirit flying free
Then step outside your mind and cross over the line
Don't spend your lifetime weeping
For things that ain't worth keeping
Life can be very short and you know everybody is bought

So I'm gonna move out on the highway
Head on down the road leaving it all behind
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time
Living on the edge. Running with the wind
Soaring to the heights on an eagle's wing

Mescalitos' song will help you to be strong

Head on down the road leaving it all behind
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time"

Cause it's only lonely spots
He shares with you
And long halls and the gray walls
Are gonna split apart

There's life after high school

And that's why

got a bad reputation

With the student body

Hot and cool (huh, huh)

About what you wear

And talkin about it (huh, huh)

You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but another odd number (huh, huh)
Memories that you won't remember
So you got a little education (huh, huh)
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school (huh, huh)
Maybe some of it'll rub off on ya
The boys are busy in the mirrors (huh, huh)
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
(huh, huh)
More memories you won't remember
The senior with the Junior Miss (huh, huh)
I wonder what the junior wishes

That she could graduate to adult (huh, huh)
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Been running so fast

And one's just hangin' on
It seems my weaknesses
Just keep going strong

How did it feel
Did it surprise you when you found yourself unselfish
Did it seem unreal
The pressure's everywhere - everywhere around you
Beckon you to turn the other way
But I say the results are superficial
There's only one way to play

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Give - when you have anything at all to give

After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Put your head where your feet are going
'Cause the good outweighs the bad
It's you that should be - you should be knowing
It's for what you give not what you have
When it seems you - you can't give enough
Realize it's the good you do it for
So when the going gets a little bit tough
You've got to give a little bit more
Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for

After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

When you're looking for an answer
Nothing seems to fit
Don't give up
You've got to let your heart become the
Mirror of your mind
Give in

Don't wait for something to cause you reason
Set your goal let your mind follow through
When you feel something to believe in
You'll make all your dreams, all your dreams come true

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again
Give-when you have anything at all to give

Blew my worries to the sky

Tired of being treated like a kid
Her friends keep saying she better act her age
But he'd never notice her if she did
She paints her eyes and colors her cheeks
Slides her nylons up her legs
She's going to wrap his love around her little finger
And squeeze 'til the poor boy begs

She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She's going to show them all a thing or two
She wants to do what the big girls do

She takes his hand when he asked her to dance
As they move out onto the floor
The other girls talk behind her back
But they're really wishing they were her
She's been waiting for such a long, long time
Not going to turn back now
She's gonna do a little growing up tonight
And he's going to show her how

She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She's going to show them all a thing or two
She wants to do what the big girls do
On a deserted road, she'll give her heart away
The girl is gone, a woman takes her place

She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She's going to show them all a thing or two
She wants to do what the big girls

And the city don't know what the city is getting
The crème de la crème of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner
Time flies, doesn't seem a minute

All change, don't you know that when you play at this level
There's no ordinary venue?
It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings
Or, or this place

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city
What do you mean?
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town
Tea, girls, warm and sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd! You’re talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble

To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha
And thank God I'm only watching the game, controlling it
I don't see you guys rating the kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you better go back to your bars
Your temples, your massage parlors

The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister

If what you are is real
Yeah, can I touch? Can I feel?
Are you just a fantasy?

You're the lady of my heart

Now a young love seranade blows sweet nothing in her ear
They're lonely together, when they're not apart
It feels like she's holding on to someone else in the dark

Oh the love parade is on
Even against all odds
It'll go on forever
The love parade
Only matinee shows
The love parade

But if he could put himself into a different skin
He'd be worrying about what he's let himself in for
Hanging in the air apparent

A point of view almost transparent

So you sold your soul for a pocket full of sweet talk
Forget-me-not kisses at the end of a slow walk
And when it's done you put your world back on
'Cause she's otherwise engaged married to someone
Oh the love parade goes on
Even when you're gone
It'll go on forever

All the things I know today
Baby I would not have changed on hour
'Cause I learned so much
From my mistakes

All the nights we cried
And we prayed we'd see the morning light
We never thought that we could ever make it
And you were sure
You'd never hear me say

This is the time
This is the moment
We've waited so long
Just to be standing here
We had a dream
We made it happen
Nobody believed that we could get this far
And now I know that this is our time

You never wanted any fortune or fame
You said ""Baby just give me your heart""
And now I'll tell you
Without any shame
That you were right from the start
Staying together, it ain't easy
In a wold that changes so fast
But take a look around
Our feet are squarely on the ground
'Cause we've found a love that can last

And it seems so clear
I know that this is going to be our year
We'll forget about the pain and sorrow
And we'll forget about the times we failed

This is the time
This is the moment
We've waited so long
Just to be standing here
We had a dream
My God it happened
Nobody believed that we could get this far

And I talk 'til my daddy say
Said, ""You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin""
""And there's sure to be a change in ways""

Now, there's a cheerleader that's a real big bleeder

As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin

And it started with a little kiss, like this

[Chorus: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
See-saw swinging with the boys in school
And her feet was flying up in the air

Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle with the kitty in the middle""

And they swinging like it just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way

She told me to

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Rev Run]
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way

School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hanging way up her knee

It was three young ladies in the school gym locker
And they found they were
looking at D

I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air

So instead, I chilled, that's right, chilled
Then I went to the bank, took out every dime
And then I went and canceled all those credit cards
Yeah, all your charge accounts, yeah
I stuck you up for every piece of jewelry I ever bought you
Yeah, that's right, everything, everything, didn't fly with me
Naw, don't go, you ever go, don't go looking in that closet

And waiting for you in the guest room
That's right, what was you thinking about, huh?
What were you tryin' to prove, huh? You's with the Juice
'N' I gave you silk suits, Gucci handbags, blue diamonds

I gave you things you couldn't even pronounce
Now I can't give you nothin' but advice
'Cause you're still young, that's right, you're still young
I hope you learn a valuable lesson from all this, you know?
Gonna find someone like me one of these days
Until then, know what you gotta do?
You gotta get on outta here with that alley-cat-coat wearin'
Hush-puppy-shoe-wearing crumb cake I saw you with

'Cause you dismissed! That's right, silly rabbit
Trix are made for kids, don't you know that?

You without me: like cornflake without the milk

It's my world, you just a squirrel, tryin' to get a nut
Now get on outta here! Ah! Don't touch that coat!"

So all the teachers say
It calls you day and night
It takes your thoughts away

Under a frozen light
You face a long crusade
Where there's a cause you fight
Where there's a cost you pay

You feel the passion play
(Fight) It's when reactions start
That you can't look away
(Choose) There is no wrong or right
There's just your point of view
But when you face the light
Then it will come to you

Love is the hero
Soldier forever
Life below zero
Never say never
Love is the hero (Yeah)

There is no sacrifice
There is no dead-end street
There is no sound advice
Only the watch you keep (Never say never)
With every step you take
Through every room of fear
With every move you make
The song will pull you near

(Turn) You turn your world around
And it will come your way
(Through) Through your cold-chill nights
And in your hard-earned days
(Fight) When you face the light
It may be hard to do
But when it's all too right
Then it will come to you

Love is the hero
Soldier forever
Love is the hero
You live to remember

No path is too steep
No distance too wide
No question too deep
No force can divide
Your fortune you seek
The road will unwind
You're comin' to me
To search is to find
And when you start to fall
Into that frozen space
And when you reach the wall
And there's no sunny place
And when it all comes down
You make it anyhow
Anyway

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold

The tune will come to you at last

That the truth is you just can't win

It'll make you blow your cap
Sacrifice everything and money
Love has no guarantees
It'll always really be

Take stabs dip and dab
Forever tryin to find your way
It's a seller's lament
For all the love you spent

While no one was lookin' on the old plantation

They sent her away not too much later
And left him walking down the old valley road
Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on alone, alone

Out in the hall, they were talking in a whisper
Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
Everybody knew what they were talking about

Whoa, while no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He showed her what they do down the long valley road
She came back around like nothing really happened
And left him standing on the old valley road

You know parents are the same no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
So to you other kids all across the land
There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand

[Verse 1]
I remember one year
My mom took me school shoppin'
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall

My mom started buggin' with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothin' at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, “What's wrong? This shirt cost $20”

I said, “Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!”

The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963

And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!

I said, “Mom, what are you doin'? you're ruinin' my rep”
She said, “You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet”

I said, “Mom, let's put these clothes back, please”
She said “No, you go to school to learn, not for a fashion show”

I said, “This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer

Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers

But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks”

She wasn't moved, everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, “No, no way, uh-uh, forget it”
There was nothin' I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were crackin' up, laughin' at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughin' still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, “If they were laughin', you don't need them
'Cause they're not good friends”
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times

So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand
[Verse 2]
Okay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche

Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not

I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't
Yeah, of course, I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walkin'
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talkin'

You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions

I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, “Was that for me?”
I said, “Yeah”
She said, “Why?”
I said, “Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy”
She said, “How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic”
I said, “C'mon, toots, my name is the Prince
Besides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?
”
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive

We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, “Drive fast, speed turns me on”

She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas

We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sunroof was open, the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doin' ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, “I don't have a license, but I drive very well, officer”
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway

I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, “Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?”
They didn't speak - I said, “I wanna plead my case”
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you other kids all across the land
Take it from me, parents just don't understand"

Next thing she spent up all my money
Had me in debt, you and your girl’s dizzy
Stopped movin’ crack, but you’re still gettin’ pissy
You could call me everyday God sent

Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!

He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway!

He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm sleep

I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street!


[Verse 1: Fresh Prince]
It was a Saturday evening, if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and bum rushed the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right though 'cause the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin', cold havin' a ball
And somethin' ‘bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent, you know nothing real fancy
About this homeboy named Freddy and this girl named Nancy
But word when it was over I said, “Yo, that was def!”
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!
[Verse 2: Fresh Prince & Freddy Kruger]
It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, man, I was buggin'

I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke

Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You turned off David Letterman, now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside in my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do, we got a lot of work here, me and you
The souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brain""

I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest, man, this team won't work
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""

I pat him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street
[Outro: Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff & Freddy Krueger]
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man
Hello?

Jeff, wake up

I hear ya, hit it!

When lo and behold, there appeared a mirage
He was hooking up a car in his daddy's garage
We stopped short, did a double take
He was looking so fly I thought I wasn't awake
He was obviously hooking up bass I assumed
But then he turned the little button and the car went boom

Without hearing the boom pouring out your car
So if your speakers weak, then please turn it off

But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Verse One]
Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said: ""Hey, you're kind of cute"" I said: ""Yes, I know, but...
By the way, sweetheart, what's your name?""
She said: ""My friends like to call me Exotic Elaine""
I said: ""My name is the Prince"" and she said: ""Why?""
I said: ""Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy!
But enough about me, yo, let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do""
I popped some trash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town, I wined her and dined her
She asked me 'did I like her?' I said: ""Well... kinda""
All of a sudden, she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me, kissin' and huggin'
So I shoved her away, I said: ""You better stop buggin'!""
She got mad, looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out: ""Rape!""

I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin' through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up, they almost beat me to death
I was arrested, charged with aggravated assault
(Hey, yo Clancy, we got him!) But it wasn't my fault!
[Chorus: Fresh Prince]
Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Verse Two]
I was in a bar one Friday night
Coolin', watchin' a Mike Tyson fight

I was maxin' and relaxin', sippin' on tequila
When this girl walked up, she said: ""Hi, my name is Sheila""
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said: ""Let's go""
20 minutes later, things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house, I said: ""I'm with you, toots""
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me, she grabbed me close and that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back, I said: ""Oh, your hands are cold!""
We went into her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said: ""Baby, where are you?""
Her boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin
And said: ""Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb!""
I was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?
I just yelled: ""Geronimo!"" and jumped out the window

Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off, I had to break in my place
Because my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case

I hope this doesn't happen too often, but
[Chorus: The Fresh Prince]
Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble

Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Prince] I don't know, I don't think they really get it, man...
[Jazzy] I think you should give 'em another example!
[Prince] Aight, give me a scratch, let's make it funky right here...

[Verse Three]

I got a ring on my phone, May 5th last year
It was my girlfriend Betty, I said: ""Hello dear!
I was just about to call you
I got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert"" (I'm wit' it)

""It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready?"" (Yeah)
""Aight, fine, see you then, Betty""
I combed my hair, washed, and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif

Got to Betty's at eight, I was ready to jet
Until Betty's mom said: ""Betty's not ready yet!""
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35, she comes downstairs
And said: ""I need a little longer to finish my hair""
At ten o'clock, we had been missed the show
She comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!?
""Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone!""
I was steamin' like a demon as I drove home
[Outro: Fresh Prince]
But it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme
Just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away!

[Outro]

[Jazzy] Man, first your parents just don't understand...

[Prince] I know, right, man...
[Jazzy] Then you have these crazy nightmares...

[Prince] Look, why me? Why me?...
[Jazzy] What's next?
[Prince] Not these girls man, but... you know how it is... can't live wit' 'em...

[Prince & Jazzy] ...can't live without 'em"

Waiting for the phone to ring
Hoping it will be the man of my dreams

Sitting, staring
Tossing and turning
Phone, please ring
I'm just burning and burning with

Anticipation
The situation
Makes me think I'm crazy
For waiting around
But just to talk to
Makes my heart pound

I don't understand the feelings I have
But I know my body shivers
When he crosses my path

I hope he lasts forever
Like the heavens above
He makes me feel so good
But is it love?
Love, love, love

[Verse 2:]
I may be young
But my feelings are true
Some people think I don't know what to do
But I do

'Cause that's how I'm living
That's why my man are constantly giving me
Roses and flowers
And beautiful gifts

And I really love the way
It feels when we kiss
But don't get me wrong because
I'm as pure as the snow

I'm waiting for the right man
Don't you know
And when I find him
I hope that we're as tight as a glove
But I have to ask myself, is it love?

Love, love, love
[Verse 3:]
Am I being silly?
Or can this really be?
That I've really fallen in love so easily?

I haven't known him long
But the feelings are real
Content and satisfied is how I feel
Whenever he's near me
And even when he's not

My heart is on fire
And I just can't seem to stop
Wanting him, needing him
Calling out his name
Is it love
Or is it insane?

Only time will tell
If we'll reach the white glove
'Cause I need to know
Is it love?

Love, love, love

Is it love?"

Alright, dig it

[Verse 1]
Cold coolin' at a bar
And I'm lookin for some action
But like Mick Jagger said
I can't get no satisfaction


The girls are all around
But none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def
Yo, what's up with L-O-C?

The girls is all jockin'
At the other end of the bar

Havin drinks with some no-name chump
When they know that I'm the star


So I got up and strolled over
To the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?""
He said, ""Funky Cold Medina
""

Funky Cold Medina
[Verse 2]
This brother told me a secret
On how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass
And the girls'll come real quick

It's better than any alcohol
Or aphrodisiac

A couple of sips of this love potion
And she'll be on your lap

So I gave some to my dog
When he began to beg

Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the wild thing
on my leg

He used to scratch and bite me
Before he was much, much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house
For the Funky Cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin'?
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door
I got Spuds MacKenzie

Alex from Stroh's

They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal
[Verse 3]
I went up to this girl
She said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go
With a little Funky Cold Medina

She said, ""I'd like a drink,""
I said, ""Ehm, I'll go get it""
And then a couple sips she cold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it

So I took her to my crib
And everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess
Sheena was a man


So I threw him out, I don't fool around
With no Oscar Mayer wiener

You must be sure that your girl is pure
For the Funky Cold Medina

You know?
Ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's, and you know I'm down with the ladies

No joke
Break it down

[Verse 4]
Back in the saddle
Lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on
""The Love Connection""


The audience voted
And you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton
For Medina and some dinner

We had a few drinks
I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' 'bout
Plans for our wedding

Said ""Wait. Slow down love, not so fast
Baby, I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't fool around
With the Funky Cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin'?
That Medina's a monster

You had your turn, now retire

Don't talk back, I'm not a new jack
'Cause I'm fresher than you, and you're wack
I keep tryin', I'm not lyin'
Up to number one is where I'm flyin'
I won't slow down 'cause I'm the new kid
With the devastatin' sound that hits
In the house where I used to practice
No one knew the Rob exists, but now
I'm gettin' greedy, don't lead me
The wrong way 'cause is just might, might, might
Bring me down, I'll have to fight to get back up
Move away 'cause I just won't slack up

Now, I go to shows to watch other MC's rock
And if they're good, I don't knock
The way they perform 'cause I like to see a good show
After that, go play ceelo, y'know

'Cause I'm a leader, no ,I'm not a follower
And MCs like you I swallow 'em
So don't look and try to judge me
Because you think that I'm another MC, well
I'm the new kid, I just moved around
But that don't mean I can't rip up the town
Me and my boys, we make noise
I hate MC's that think that we're toys
I'm hittin' harder than any other MC
Who try to come up and go against me

Let 'em have it, Rob Base, one time
[Verse 4: Rob Base]
Not from the old school or from the new
Applaud or boo
, do what you want to
Talk to me then try to put me down
We used to be cool now we don't hang around
Used to be friends but now we're foes
Ask me why, man, no one knows
Maybe jealousy between you and me
Could be the fame, could be the money

I'm goin' for mine and I don't really care
'Cause the spotlight Rob Base don't share
I'm the headliner of this show

And you're just a kid and you need to grow because

Give it to 'em, Rob Base
Everybody clap your hands now

Let me tell ya I went to his fight a couple months ago
I seen him hit this boy, and he hit the boy so hard
His head flew off into the eigtheenth row
(laughing) They had to get his head out of the eighteenth row

[Verse One: Prince & Jeff]
I was in Jeff's crib one night about eight
And we were watchin' a couple of Mike Tyson fight tapes
Jeff was like...
Man, you see how hard Mike's punchin'?

Come on Jeff the other guy was just lungin'
Left, right, left, right, another K.O
If that was me I'd a been okay though
The very next day I gave Russell a ring
With J.L. and Lyor
we all called Don King

I said ""Yeah, Don I got a problem
Tell 'em Prince
Yeah what's up? what you sayin? You tryin' to solve 'em?
Forget the small talk, let's get to the nitty gritty'

[Verse Two: Fresh Prince & Lawrence the Barber]
There was press conference to see what trainin' I was doing
Before then I had never heard reporters booing
Cameras flashing, I was in the middle
I didn't wanna look dumb so I exaggerated a little
I said, ""Uh, I been trainin' twenty hours a day
Liftin' big old cars and big bales of hay
(That's what you're doing)
And I jog 10,000 miles every morning
Thinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory

I drink water, 20 gallons a pop
And I can throw a Volkswagen a whole half block
(He can do it too)
And 4 million sit ups... in a minute...
I ain't lyin' I did it!""
The general public thought I was a fool
I was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool
Well gettin' dissed is never good
But I was even gettin' dissed in my old neighborhood
I was at the corner at the top of my block
There was a couple of people standing outside of the barber shop
It was Lawrence, my barber and friend
And he yelled out:
Hey, Prince, you can win!
I said 'really?' and I stopped to chat
You could beat him man, if you hit him with a bat
Ha ha...you gon' get wrecked
But can I have your shoes when he break your neck?
Everybody was laughin' out loud
I thought at least my own Grandma would be proud
I went to her house and snuck in to surprise her
I heard her on the phone
""A thousand bucks on Tyson!""

[Old men]
Hey, Leroy, i thought that boy was joking, [?] he really gon' get in the ring!
Man, i don't think that boy can beat that big football player
Man, i keep tellin', ya, he ain't no football player, he a boxer
Hey, Leroy, we gotta do something, that boy gon' kill himself!

The Lightnin' Rodent, the Fresh Prince! (crowd boos)
And in this corner
The heavyweight champion of the world
'Iron Mike' Tyson! (crowd cheers)
I came out hustling, slidin' and grabbing
Slippin' and dippin' hustlin' and jabbin'
For a second I looked good out there (yep)
But then Mike brought to reality (look out) my worst nightmare
One punch, that's all it took (oooh)
He hit me in my ribs and my insides shook
Now how can I say this and be a little discreet?
Let's just say that my bowels released
I called timeout and went back to my corner
Said to my coach, ""Ain't no way I'm goin'
The hell back out there, man you can forget it
My body's like a punching bag and Mike is gonna (Hit it)""
They tried to make me go meet my doom
But I sucker punched my coach and hauled to my dressin' room
The next day the headline in the town
""Fresh Prince breaks camp, Tyson wins, first round""
Some fool asked why I ran away
I said, ""A good run is better than a bad stand any day""
My career is over as far as fightin'
But I don't know what made me think I can beat Mike Tyson

'Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week

So to my first class, I run and don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
And as I get to the room, I hear the teacher say
""Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today""

I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
As I try to get up, I find there's gum on my seat

So with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand
And said, ""Excuse me but can I go to the bathroom, ma'am?""
The teacher got upset, and she screamed out ""No!
It's off the principal's office you go.""
[Verse 2]
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria

Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
And when I tried the applesauce, I heard it crunch

I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken
The nurse just laughed, and said, ""You must be joking.""
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
No joke 'cause my front tooth is out of place

So I walked to school with ice on my lip
The nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
My books are real heavy, I'm walking, I'm dragging
Ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it

Forget class, I'm a shoot some ball
With the late pass I got no trouble at all
But then the nurse walks up and says ""What do you know?
It's off to the principal's office you go.""

Recess

[Verse 3]
Passing notes is my favorite pastime
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
To express my feeling
Give me a week B, and the girl'll be dealing
Now one young lady was looking at me
I said ""Hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC""
But then the ball rang, and the teacher came in
And that's when the game of passing notes would begin

I wrote the first note, told her she was fine
And I hoped that the two of us could spend some time
She wrote me back and told me ""You're fine too
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you""

So then I sat there reeling and looking at the ceiling
Words can't express the way that I was feeling
Then I thought to myself, the sure way to get her
Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter

When I finished the note, it was ready to pass
The teacher took it and read it right in front of the class
She read it word by word and line by line
And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine

Even my girl was laughing and it was too late
For me to write another note 'cause there would be no date
The teacher looked at me, and I said ""I know
It's off to the principal's office I go.""

Hey, hey, ya, ya, you got it going on
Aah na-na, na-na


Now I wrote this record for when I perform
Lonely nights inside a university dorm
I put pen to paper with a paper and pen
For the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men

I get raw like Eddie
, rough like Freddy
Krueger with a Luger turnin' men into spaghetti

I'm like Fats Domino off of Blueberry Hill
Because my rhymes are funky fresh and not run of the mill


Just like a king has palaces, I give an analysis
You can't talk because you suffer from paralysis
Of the mouth, of the lip, of the tongue
Comin' to you compliments of a brother named Young

Now you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless
So be quiet and let an educator teach this
It's due to my producer, so he's in a rage
And Mike, you control the vinyl, I'll control the stage

'Cause I come off
Yo, I come off

There were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know

Four score and seven years later
I dig holes in those rappers like the moon with a crater

Because to battle me you're really taking a risk
'Cause you're an 8-track tape and I'm a compact disc

Like Tyson drops boxers in rapid succession
That's how I'm droppin' MCs in the rappin' profession


I'm comin' off, just like the clothes on a hooker
And I can fly like Jimmy Superfly Snuka

Like a shuttle goes up into outer space
People's hands go up when I enter the place

I don't mean to brag or boast or to tell ya I'm great
But I can rock the microphone like Dorothy Hamill can skate

Yeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Louganis can dive

Don't have to be Saturday night for Young MC to get live

My name is Young MC and baby I come off
Yo the brother's comin' off

From the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old
From the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb
From the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum

You know the other rappers wanna play a game with me
They run and hide when they hear the name of Young MC
Like a kid playing tag, that's how it's got to be
So when I start I say Olly Olly Oxen Free


Yo, you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one
So pay attention cause you don't wanna miss one
Of my healthy rhymes, nobody's are healthier
New York, New Jersey, LA or Philadelphia

City to city, and town to town, place to place
Country to country, 'cause I get around
Even if you were in prison you'da heard me play
Because the warden had me rock and I'm on the PA

So when you get out come and see my show
And if you start static back, in you go

With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet

It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown

And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch


[Chorus]
I told you, homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks and pants

You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch
[Chorus]
Yo, I told you (You can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucker
(You can't touch this)

[Verse 3]
Give me a song or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit


[Chorus]
That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
You can't touch this
Break it down!

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh—
Stop, Hammer time!
[Verse 4]
Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead

So wave yo' hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner

Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)


[Chorus]
Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh—
Stop, Hammer time!

You can't touch this

You can't touch this
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)
You can't touch this
Break it down!

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh—
Stop, Hammer time!


[Verse 5]
Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit

I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay

""It's Hammer!"" ""Go Hammer!"" ""MC Hammer!"" ""Yo Hammer!""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah (You can't touch this)
I told you (Can't touch this)
Too hot (Can't touch this)
Yo, we outta here (Can't touch this)"

You're a stranger in this town
Wandering around and you feel lost

CHORUS:
Please try to find me and I'll try to find you
You know I need you just like you need me
Please don't give up cause we're almost together
We've almost made it, hold on and you'll see

When nobody wants to hear
What you want to say
And you feel down when your hope has disappeared
Like a morning train
You can't slow down

To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did

It seems years since you held the baby
While I wrecked the bedroom

You said it was dangerous after Sunday
And I knew you loved me
He thinks I just became famous
And that's sure to mess me up
But he's wrong
How could I possibly know what I want
When I was only twenty-one?

There's millions of people
Who offer advice and say how I should be
But they're twisted and they will never be
Any influence on me
But you will always be
You will always be

If I treated you mean
I really didn't mean to
But you know how it is
And how a pregnancy can change you

[Verse 2]
I see plenty of clothes that I like
But I won't go anywhere nice for a while
All I want to do is just sit here
And write it all down and rest for a while
I can't bear to be in another city
One where you are not
I would return to nothing without you
If I'm your girlfriend or not

Maybe I was mean
But I really don't think so
You asked if I'm scared and I
Said so

[Verse 3]
Everyone can see what's going on
They laugh 'cause they know they're untouchable
Not because what I said was wrong

Whatever it may bring

I will live by my own policies
I will sleep with a clear conscience
I will sleep in peace

Maybe it sounds mean
But I really don't think so
You asked for the truth, and I

Well, you gang members, you still don't get it, do ya?

(""Unh! With your bad self"")

[Verse 1: King Tee]
It's straight up madness everywhere I look
Used to be a straight-A student, now he's a crook
Robbing people just to smoke or shoot up
Used to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-butt
Dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang
Hanging on the streets selling 'caine
To his own people
Now when I say people I mean color
You a stupid mother (unh)
I'm trying to stress the fact that you're dumb
Get yourself presentable, son, and just come
Together, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late
A message from King Tee The Great
[Verse 2: Body & Soul]

Sisters, since we are the mothers of this earth
It's time we start being good mothers from the birth
Of our children, no time for sleeping
Teach them to fight and win for the right reason
It's your time, it's your life, live it
Proud to be black, young and gifted
Lifted by the knowledge and taking the right route
Gang violence needs to be wiped out
A-L-M-I-G-H-T-Y and Dee-Z-I-R-E
We see the F-U-T-U-R-E
Should be a positive thing
Body & Soul and you, we're in the same gang

[Verse 3: Def Jef]
One and the same
Everyone came in the same chains
Caught with the same aim
Brain games and names changed
To protect the innocent bystander
Lies, slander and the master-planner
Destroy the black male
Crack jail and semi-automatic
For static if the crack fails
So since we all talk the same slang
Stop killin, my brother, 'cause we're all from the same gang
[Chorus: Michel'le]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Make the change cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 4: Tone-Loc]
Now as a youth, I used to get my bang on
And on the ave, get my part-time slang on
[?] time for me was no joke though
They knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco

Khakis creased, golf hat, feelin' sporty
Low ridin' and tossin' up a forty

Thinkin in my mind that no one could handle us
The downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles
I found life was much more suitable
'Cause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful
I ain't slippin' or down with a head trip
I'm talkin' to all the Bloods and all the Crips
Throw down your rag and get on the right track, man
It's time to fight, unite, and be a black man
Tone-Loc is on a positive change
'Cause remember, we're all in the same gang

[Verse 5: Above The Law]
Bein' the pimps that we are
We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far
Here at home in the ghettos of LA
Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day
'Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made a beat

But fools just lay and prey on the weak
It don't depend on the color of a rag
Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have
Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs
And gangs that bang
Most times it's a political thang
Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped
And if the government wanted to freeze it, it could all get stopped
But they don't because they want it like that
Because the system's been set up to hold us back
Yeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever
So why don't we stick together?
(You got it)
[Verse 6: Ice-T; Hen-G]
Ice-T rippin' the microphone the way I do
Listen close, my brothers, 'cause I'm talkin to you
The problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle
'Cause 90 percent of us are livin' foul and wild
I say ""job"", you say ""Bad joke
I'd rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke""
Livin in the fast lane flippin like you're insane
You won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain
I got an idea, give me a minute
And if it makes sense, then get with it
What if we could take our enemies, feed em poison
Undereducate their girls and boys and
Split em up, make em fight one another
Better yet, make em kill for a color

All my brothers need to know one thing
No matter what you think, we're all in the same gang

[Chorus]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Stop the fighting
(Make the change)
Because we're all in the same gang

[Verse 7: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]
Yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers
We're telling like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister
Reality speaks for itself when it's spoken
A basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smoking
Yo, bullets flying, mothers crying, brothers dying
Lying in the streets, that's why we're trying
To stop it from falling apart and going to waste
And keeping a smile off a white face
N.W.A never preaching, just teaching
The knowledge of the streets to each and
All that don't understand, that's why we came
To let you know that we're all in the same gang

[Verse 8: JJ Fad]
The J double, F, the A, the D, that is
And if you want the solution to the quiz
What's black and black, yo, and kills another?

An ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother
But another
So now it's time we evolve
And get together and solve it
Cause the world is revolvin
Around a terrible situation
One will kill another for a reputation
So it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same
Yo Train, tell em (We're all in the same gang)

[Verse 9: Young MC]
Brothers killin' other brothers
I thought the idea was to love one another?
Open up the paper to one more death
If y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left
I try my best to set an example
Sayin hype lyrics over hip-hop samples
Not just to brag or to boast but to inform
Cause we're livin in the calm before the storm
You see, I believe that the children are the future

But what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya?
We're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed
And I want to see all young people succeed
Do 9 to 5, not 5 to 10
Just go to work and not the state pen
Cause you live better when you're out there free
And that's comin straight to ya from the Young MC

[Verse 10: Digital Underground]
I'm in a rage
(Oh yeah? Yo, why is that G?)
Other races, they say we act like rats in a cage
I tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news
We prove them suckers right and I got the blues

America
(Get busy, Humpty)
The red, the white, the blue and
The blue and the red for Crips and Bloods
The white for who's got you doing time

Busting caps on one another
(The Underground's down for peace among brothers)
Kill a black man?
(What?)
Yo, what, are you retarded?
(Tell em, Hump)
Yo, do you work for the Klan?
(Do what ya like)

Unless you like gang-banging
Let's see how many brothers leave us hanging


[Verse 11: Oaktown's 3.5.7.]
The gang that should hang is the one that contains
The sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind
Now listen, get loose, it's unity time
Yeah, yeah
Peace is a presence that we all need
The future's in our hands, in word and deed
I'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD
We're 3.5.7. totally

[Verse 12: MC Hammer]
Kickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9
All the homies gettin blind in an eight ball line
Now on this tip they started runnin at the lip
Jumped in their deuce and took a little trip
Hit the block about 12 on the tick
The windows went down and the nines went click
People started yellin, bodies started bailin
Bullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and
It's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence
Peace in the hood and a moment of silence
We got together not for ego or fame
We got involved cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 13: Eazy-E]
Last but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out
And if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out
I'm not tryin to tell ya what to do
You have your own freedom of choice who to listen to
You knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong
Now your mother's singing that sad song
(My baby ain't never hurt nobody!)
But he still got smoked at BeBe's party
But you're not the first or the last
You're nothin but a short story from the past
You're dead now, not number one but a zero
Take notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero

If I keep looking, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have

(Tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind
The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like Houdini, be magic and why don't you appear
(Have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love
Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ

Hello
Long distance operator, we have a collect call from Doc Box for Mr. Hami Wave. Will you accept the charges?
Yeah
Go 'head, sir
Yo, what's up, man? This is Doc, man
Hey, what's up?
Yo, I know you workin' on a slow cut, but my female wanna say something to you
Cool, cool, go 'head
Here, Bonnie
Hami, when you do that slow cut, could you put that boom in it for me?
Bust it
Slow love (Damn, that sound good)

Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love
[Verse 1: Doc Box]
Girl, I can hardly wait 'til we're alone in my room
You bring the blanket, I'll bring the boom
I know the night is young, but that's just as well
'Cause by the time we're through, the night'll be old as hell
Turn off the TV, we'll be doin' it from dawn to dusk
The couple on the screen ain't got nothin' on us
We'll make love in slow motion like we're suspended in time
Erotic movements 'cause our bodies do become intertwined
Uh, tell me, girl, are you ready for lust?
Tonight I plan on givin' you the maximum thrust
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
Word 'em up, Cool J, man, I know just how you feel
I'm aroused by your every touch
The very sound of your voice gets my gander up
It seems the longer we do it, it only gets better
So I'ma blow Keith Sweat and make it last forever

[Chorus: Hami Wave | Debra Killings]
Slow love
Makin' slow love (We can take, we can take our time)
(Let's not rush this thing) Let's make slow love

Makin' slow love (We'll be makin' slow love)
Let's make slow love
[Verse 2: B. Fresh]
Girl, me and you will hug tight in my living room dark
You're in your negligée and I'm just casually sharp
The only utter of light comes from the moon into the window
We're alone, slow music playing and then so
I ask you to dance, you willingly respond
By saying (Yes) and takin' me in your arms
So I walk you to the dance floor down in my room
Switch on the set lights as you put on perfume
Grab your body, pull you close, then pull you closer
My love starts to grow so I walk you to the sofa
Aroused by your beauty like when we first met
You walked into my life, then my future was set
Standing with me by the couch and sexy looks on your face
Like saying, ""Take me, I'm yours"" and ""Love me down to the bass""
I laid you down, kissed your navel, then moved up above
From your breast to your neck, hit the lights and make

[Chorus: Hami Wave | Debra Killings]
Slow love
Makin' slow love (We can take, we can take our time, oh, hmm)
Let's make slow love (Oh, oh, ooh)

Let's make slow love (Slow love)
Let's make slow love (And it feels so good to me, baby)

Uh, girl, when you're next to me (When you're next to me)
I'm in heaven, ecstasy (We're in ecstasy)
You're drivin' me crazy
Oh, now it's me and you, baby (Ooh, ho, ho, ho)
And then my adrenaline starts to flow
Girl, then it's up and down we go (Ooh)
Ooh, I feel your body shake (Give it to me, baby)
Girl, I'll give you all you can take
Let's make slow love
Can you feel it?
Let's make slow love

But you were the type of girl that set love free
Now I'm out cold, you stole my heart from me
But I know someday you'll think back every memory

Chorus:
Now what will I do
Now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you
Now what will I do, now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you

Now love is gone
You're far away from me
You would have been so rich with love but set it free
Now you want home but it's too late for me
'Cause I won't be used and abused and then set free

Cause you're the type of girl that keeps me smiling
And feeling like I'm on fantasy Island
You got touch that drives men crazy
So won't you step to the man Doug Lazy
And into the swing of a wild thing
Until we hear the fat lady start to sing

He fell like a rock, she kinda liked him
And his heart beat like thunder, as they moved 'cross the floor
When the music was over, she slipped out of his arms and out the door (Yes, she did)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, a man loves a woman, but he can't understand
Why she's sad when she stares at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club, where the long shadows fall
Drop a coin in the jukebox, not the phone on the wall

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, maybe more than today
We're so close, so close, yet so far away

Some people think, if you really believe
That's what you need to solve all the mysteries
Yeah, I know someone who just heads for the sun
She says ""I don't wanna be wise, I just wanna stay young""

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, but we're stuck in today
Baby, we're so close, so close, so far away

There's a restless look in your eye tonight
There's a secret hurt in my heart (So close)
And the dream that pulls us together, girl
Is a dream, that's gonna tear us, tear us apart
There's a restless look in your eye tonight
Oh, are you lookin' for some way out of here? (So close)
We gotta fight to keep it together, girl
For the dream, that keeps us

And fly like two birds of a feather

Feelings and that's why I always try
To be loyal and gentle, lay and let
Observe the female in case I must leave camp
And if I have to break out, you don't deserve
To live a good life and love a black hummingbird
It may be sexy but it is true
If you try to adore me, then I'll adore you
But if you treat me right, then
I'll treat you with opens arms and a rose just to greet you
Love you dearly, respect and care for
You my dear, so how could you ignore
The way I feel is real from the start
So I stopped playing games and mastered the art

Waking up to another day that will soon be over
And if you think that time has forgotten you
Well just look into my eyes
And know the times we'll change

Don't hold back your love

I wanna see it come to life before my eyes
Don't hold back your love
Show me your heart
Cause I will always be here by your side

Don't be mistaken there's still some work to do
Gotta get up every single day
Face the judge and jury
No one will notice they've got their own lives
We've got something they all want
It'll be their surprise
And if you think there is no place to run
Just hold onto my hand
And face whatever comes
Don't hold back your love
I know it's here
I wanna see it come to life before my eyes
Don't hold back your love
Show me your heart
Cause I will always be here by your side

One more chance before the curtain's down
One more night to turn your life around again

Hard envy, you really send me
Don't stand close or you'll offend me

You? the peoples at the door
You know the game, you know the score
Here's a girl, the bitter pill

You know, I work hard
For the things that I've got
You just need to get up off
Your behind and get yourself together

Naw, uh uh, don't be ragging on me
For trying to do my thing

Human emotion
Share your feelings with the needy
Can't you see, it's a drop in the ocean
Why so resentful

Feel content, no regard for yur brother
With a chip upon your shoulder
Do your best to respect one another
Show compassion if you
Want a slice of action

Oh, jealousy
You want everything that I've got
Wanna have your cake and eat it
Jealousy, easier to have than have not
Wanna have your cake and eat it

Yo, the? with the plan
Have respect for your brother man
Why get upset, enjoy success
Run with the pack, forget the rest

Action wasted in your brain
Hard to take, let me explain
If jealousy is your claim to fame
You may be joining my campaign

If you want it, go right out and take it
Feel the sweat on your neck in silence
I enjoy it and the tension, you destroy it

Don't give a damn
There's no limit, boy
You either lose or win it
Leave me scared
My pride, I will swallow
For the living, leave me in
A raging frenzy

Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream spinning (Spinning)
In your head (Spinning, spinning, spinning)
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life

So here it is, another chance
Wide awake, you face the day
Your dream is over
Or has it just begun?


[Verse 1]
There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night

Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly, you hear and see
This magic new dimension


[Chorus]
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you in silent lucidity

[Bridge]
""Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control

(Help me) Dream control
How are we feeling today, better?
Dream control (Help me)
Dream control (Help me)
Dream control (Help me)
Dream control (Help me)""


[Verse 2]
If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within come tumbling down
And a new world will begin

Living twice at once, you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head, master of illusion

Can you realize your dream's alive?
You can be the guide, but
[Chorus]
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night

I am smiling next to you"

And my heartache is healing
I couldn't let it die, no I knew it would survive

Not so long ago in a purple haze
People dreamed out loud they were not afraid
They stopped the war but not the dying
Some got a little bit lost along the way
But somehow we're here today and we say
The dream is still alive after all this time
The flame keeps on burning
The dream is still alive, the one of you and I

Sitting in my bedroom
The rain is pouring down
The shade is on the window
And loneliness is all around
A little voice I'm hearing
Says, ""don't you stay inside""
Now I can't fight this feeling
Got L.U.S.T. on my mind

[Verse 2]
I head for the arena where lovers try their fate
Moving through the darkness
I take my place and wait
A pretty bird beside me says hello with her eyes
She looks so sweet and lovely
But is she N.A.S.T.Y?

[Chorus]
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N

[Verse 3]
Her lips are calling to me
No way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling
Intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle
We set our bodies free
And while the music played on
She loved me down from A to Z
[Verse 4]
The night is getting longer
I start to realize
Don't know what I've got into the girl is C.R.A.Z.Y
I try to cool the fire (fire) like I oughta should
But there's no way to turn back
The S.E.X. is just too good

Don't be tempted to touch the fire
I should've read all the warning signs
You might get burned by your own desire
I lost my mind
I must have been blind
[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I never knew another lover that was evil under cover
Then I discovered you, girl
You're like no other
Doing the time for the crime
Was I blind
To the games that you were playing
Words that you were saying

Going out of my mind, you're like a hurricane
Drive me insane, you're like a heart attack
Know it's a fact
You got the knack to drop a man to his knees

Yet another round
Weekend coming up
In this funky town

Homeboys and homegirls
Shaking loose
Some come to be seen
Some come to drink juice

Some get it
Some get more than enough
Some don't, you can tell
'Cause they always play tough

For a lady, four o'clock
Cracked up, backed up
Against the wall
Some get smacked up

But no matter what you do
You know the name of the game
Yo, we all came for the same

Shaking, breaking
Girl, shaking
Get on the dance floor
And I'll take in
Our affinity to rock it
And pump it up
The funky rhythm makes me go
And I just can't stop

Don't hang on the walls
What's the matter with you people
I don't take no crap

Come on, baby, get serious, yeah
Come on, baby, get serious
Come on, come on, come on, yeah
Come on

Don't matter how fast you walk
I'm faster
Don't let it get to you
I'm the master

Turn up the bass and get acquainted
When I get into the wax of the groove
Yo, I admit that I'm a hitman
And a rap man, some people even think
That I'm tougher than Batman

I'm in action, main attraction
Come at ya like?
Don't stand there waiting
Get your feet to the floor
Yo, you know me
You'll be back for more

'Cause the law of nature
Homeboys and homegirls
Getting beat?

I brought the mic
That makes you go whack
If that'll make you happy
You're on the wrong track

Scram or jam
Get set or miss it
It's simple as that
I don't take no crap

Come on, baby, get serious, yeah
Come on, baby, get serious
Come on, come on, come on, yeah
Come on

When I'm rocking the mic
You can be just what you wanna be
Party killing
Accept that I'm your enemy
Spread the word
I'll get to you someday
You can't resist
No matter what some say

Non-stop hip-hop
Yo, listen up
Nobody's stopping me now
You're on my list and uh

You can't get off the hook
'Cause you're already shook
I'm gonna shake it some more
Take you around and look

You got to realize
I got the best setup
Inclination with the mix
I make you get up

Your reaction to my go go attraction
Is uh, body and soul interaction

And if it's too fast for you
You're too slow for me
You got to learn to keep up
Else go home and be

Turning back?
Suffer from jet lag
Yo, mack, I don't take no crap

Come on, baby, get serious, yeah
Come on, baby, get serious
Come on, come on, come on, yeah
Come on

(Hey hey)

Okay, this is what I say
About when I was a young man
Back in the day
I see a young lady
Thinking she was fine
Then I try to step to her
Just to make her mine
Bet, I proceed with a plan
Tellin' her how I could be her man

Lookin' in her eyes
While I tossed the bait
But she threw it right back in my face
Now I wanted this girl just to talk to me
But she wouldn't even take the time to walk to me
I got dissed
And that made me made
So I ran home just to tell my dad
I had a question, for my dear father
If girls treat you this bad, why bother?

He said you're learnin' somethin' everyone else knows
Just listen close son
'Cause that's the way love goes
(Ah hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
Now I remember
When I got older
The ladies got hotter
And my luck got colder
Girls tellin' me I won't go for that
Just because Young MC was not phat
Now by Phat, I don't mean overweight
I mean makin' crazy dollars
'Til they come in a crate
Ya see, I had myself a job
I worked as hard as I could
But to the young ladies
It was just no good

Wow, I guess you can't win for losin'
Havin' bad luck with the girls you're choosin'
I said to myself these dames are wack
But give me some time and I'm gonna get them back
But for now I manage my situation
I'm pickin' my women all across the nation
I'm havin' rough times with the girls I chose
But I'll have to deal, because yo
That's the way love goes
(Yuh hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes

(BRIDGE)
Alright, I went out last night
Thinking about a girl that would treat me right
I find myself chillin' at a discoteque
And the night went better than I could expect
One girl, down for the whole evenin'
For when I got there to when I was leaving
We went to her place and got in a cab
She said she was a model
I said, yo, alright
We opened up a window to watch a full moon
But the night was much colder than the afternoon
She started to shiver
So I gave her my sweater
I said you alright?
She said, yeah much better
I held her close, she felt good in my arms
And I knew this girl would do me no harm
Thinkin' how the two of us could be as one
Then I fell asleep before my boat was done
Now I woke up, I was still in her place
In the mornin' sunlight I could see her face
Yo, I tried to get up, so I could start my day
But I merely knocked over my breakfast tray
Now this girl went and made breakfast for me
When last night was the first time she saw me
You win some, you lose some, I suppose
Well I feel like a winner, yo
'Cause that's the way love goes
(Ah hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes

The Devil came up to Michigan, he was lookin' for a soul to steal

He had trouble in mind, as he drove on the line, he was looking to make a deal
He had a brand new Nissan truck, convertible
, with a portable phone

He had a Kenwood deck
that was bumpin' loud as he stopped in a no-parking zone

The Devil stepped out with a beeper on his hip
, a black Fila suit
that was down
But then he turned his head when his eyes got red when he heard this scratchin' sound
He walked up on a boy on two turntables
, this boy was rippin' the cut

So the Devil jumped up on the back of his truck and said, ""Boy, let me tell you what:
You rock the beat pretty good boy, but naw, it ain't nothin' new
Cause I'm in yo' town, 'bout to take that crown, and ain't nothin' that you can do!
But if you wanna get bad, don't make me mad, we can make this little bet true
A turntable of gold against your soul, I think I'm better than you!""

The boy said, ""My name's 'The Butcher'
and I'm the baddest around in this city
You start messin' with me and I'm sure you'll see you're gonna feel real itty-itty-bitty
But I'll take that bet and you're gonna regret,"" and then The Butcher started flexin' his wrist
But then the Devil's posse all jumped in, then they broke it on down like this:

Hit it!


Devil's in the House!


[Verse 2]
When the Devil got done scratchin' everyone knew he wasn't no joke
Because his records caught on fire, the turntables went up in smoke
The Devil's posse got in a circle and gave each other high-fives
They thought The Butcher had lost; party-party time to get live!
The Butcher started stretchin', he yawned and looked at the Devil
Then he dropped his arms down by his side and kind of giggled and laughed at the fellow
He had some Double Mint gum
so he put it in his mouth, I guess he enjoyed the taste
But then he threw the gum wrapper in the Devil's face and stepped back and hollered out, ""Bass!""
[Verse 3]
The Devil bowed his head because he knew he had been beat
So he laid that fresh turntable of gold down by The Butcher's feet
The Butcher told the Devil to get out of town then he laughed dead in his face
Then The Butcher started cuttin' all over again, stepped back and hollered out, ""Bass!"""

Well, you've never seen a kat with so much charisma
Got more moves than a mutant ninja (turtle, that is)
And I'm doing the Skat Strut
To hell with John Travolta and the Disco Duck
They call me Skat Kat, the dance floor maniac
One move of my hip is like an aphrodisiac
Swingin' and wingin', I'm just doing my own thing
Girls, don't jump me
Give me room to get funky

[Verse 2: MC Skat Kat, Fatz and Earth, Wind & Fire]
Step to the dance floor, bust a little spin
(I thought I taw a puddy tat, I did!)
Shut up, kid
This is a new dance, so shake your butt
And get a load of what it's like to be doing the Skat Strut

Now Jack was nimble and Jack was quick
But it was Skat Kat that made Jack trip
I burned him on the butt with a flick of my Bic
And then I cold ran away with the candlestick
I've got all the right moves
Ladies think I'm lovable
Love to wine and dine, sippin' on bubble
But most of all, I like dancing, y'all
And doing my Skat Strut from wall to wall

[Verse 4: MC Skat Kat and Fatz]
It's as simple as it gets, just stick out your neck
Lift up your leg and step to the left
Now shake a little as you groove to the beat
Bend over, shake your big booty
And if you get dizzy from shaking your butt
You must have shook the wrong end
You ain't doing the Skat Strut
(I thought I taw a puddy tat, I did, I did!)

Without a question, it's the strut to fame
I can see myself now on the aisles of ""Soul Train""
People want to know if it's meant to be silly
I say, ""only when it's done by Milli and Vanilli""
The dance is mine
A generation of felines mastered this step back in '69
Return of the Skat Strut, a brand new dance
(I thought I-) Could, but you can't
Bust it!

Why don't you step up to the microphone
And give 'em a little taste of your beatbox, boy?

Anybody got something to say?

For those who don't know me, my name is Skat
I'm the kat who did the rap in ""Opposites Attract""
Me and Paula did a duo and then I went solo
To grab the microphone
And make the ladies go ""Ho!"" (alright, alright)

And now that I've got you at my command
It's my sole opportunity to make you dance (yeah)
I want all four paws on the dance floor

Girl, you can call me up
And you an' I can talk for hours and hours at a time
This as an invitation
To a conversation
So when things get bad you know I'll be there to soothe your mind
Just call me up on the telephone
When you're all alone
And I'll give you a verbal massage
Until your man gets home
Or if you want to you know what you could do, well
You could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell

Come and ring my bell, ring my bell
(my bell, ding-dong, ding-dong)
Come and ring my bell, ring my bell

Girl the way he treats you it's a crying shame
Like you're a toy and like your life is just some silly game
How long you gonna live in a situation like this
Cause you're a princess baby and you deserve a prince
Why can't you see it, it's plain as day right here before your eyes
I'm telling the truth while your man insists on telling you lies
He stays out all night but I'd be home by 8
And oh and about loving, hmm it's grrrrrrreat
I don't mean to insult your man up
But I'm trying to plan the
Rest of our lives together forever and ever
But first you got to stand up
Pick yourself up on your own two
Cause girl don't nobody own you
You don't feel well and I can tell
But I'll be here so ring my bell

Ding dong ding, hey-hey, ring it
You can ring my bell, anytime, anyplace
Ring it (you)
Ring it (you)
Ring it, ring it Ahhh

[Verse 3]
Open up your mind and you can see that I'm
Just trying to make you happy
And like I said a 1000 times
If you didn't love me you wouldn't be calling me up every night
To wipe your tears 'cause you and your man just had another fight
Who loves ya baby, I do
You know he doesn't care about you, let him go
Where's he at now, you don't know
Laying up under some hooo-ld up, wait, just let me chill
No need for me to get ill
'cause every time your heart gets knocked over
You know I'll wipe the spill
I know this sounds like a fairy tale
But this ain't no children's book
I'm here, for you to take me dear
Just open your eyes and look
At what the future holds for you and
If you _ then you might ruin something great
Don't make a big mistake
Pay attention to what you're doing
Life is full of pitfalls, ups and down
It's sort of a mission
Now you're on a rocky road
But you can get off
Just make that decision
That you want someone to love you, adore you and hold you and treat you well
So when you're ready to be treated that way, baby you can ring my bell

And I'm ready to mangle young man single and free
Ready to get busy, down to party hardy and have a good time
All I need is a partner in crime
Call up the homies and hope they might
Say they down to paint the town red tonight
Look in the closet and pull out the hype gear

Pull up the hightop fade
and I'm outta here
Do a disco on a party of some kind
Hope that I would find myself a good time
Before I'm through and the night is done
Man I'm gonna have some fun

So I stroll on over to her and say hi
And tell her I'm the P-L-A-Y

We could take it slow with no presure
Enough respect, you won't regret
This will be a night you won't soon forget
And that's a promise from me to you
Take my hand, girl, I'm gonna see you through
You don't strike me as a woman that fronts

Whoa!
Lord have mercy
Aah, baby, c'mon

[Intro: Tone Loc]
Yeah
How you doin', sweetheart?
It's been a long time since I don't see you and all that
But I must that man
This past few weeks
I've been somethin' else

[Verse 1: Tone Loc]
So many times in life, I've been a fool
You couldn't tell me nothin', I was still cool
I played the games and I don't know why
I guess it's all a part of bein' a guy
Although the love comes straight from the heart
But the love I'm losin' you, girl, it's tearin' mine apart
I never though that I could miss you so much
Your beautiful smile, you go with the touch
I love you more than the day is long and the reason I'm feelin' like this is too strong
I wanna be the man that you want me to be
I'll change my lifestyle, no more [?] in the street
And with the chest I promise I'll serve ya a love life [?] that'll never die
So hold my hand and squeeze real tight
And make love, baby, all through the night
[Hook: El Debarge]
Wanna love you, love you, baby
Nothin' just I do
(I wanna love you, baby)
Wanna be the only one, the only one for you
(I wanna be the only one for you, baby)
I wanna be the only one that goes and squeeze you tight
(I love it like that)
I wanna be the only you make up every night

[Verse 2: Tone Loc]
Every night I fall asleep with you on my mind
The picture is perfect but I still seem blind
To the fact that all you wanted was me, Mr. Smith
Not Tone L-O-C
Sometimes a man never knows what he has
Until a true lady’s apart of his past
There is no girl that I can ever be with
To share my inner most thoughts and secrets
Love is one thing, girl, that I can give you
And in due respect I pay tribute
I must admit you’re a special kind of breed
And the warmth you’ve given me
I’m more than intrigued
With your manerisms and appeal
And the way I feel girl, you’re more than real
So hold my hand and squeeze real tight
And make love to me baby, all through the night
[Chorus: El Debarge]
Wanna Love you, love you, baby
Love you yes I do
(Ahh I wanna love you baby)
Wanna be the only one, the only one for you
(The only one for you)
I wanna be the only one
That holds and squeeze you tight
(Yeah, squeeze you so tight girl)
I wanna be the one you make love to every night

[Music break]

Ahh baby

[Verse 3: Tone Loc]
I think about the days of yesteryear
I try to fight it but I can’t help to shed a tear
Sometimes I play it off and try to pretend
You can’t hide what comes from within
You want someone to last to eternity
And with the magic between us we deserve to be
The most fortunate couple that God ever blessed
With the respect of love and happiness
So baby come and stand by your man
I’m looking for a woman not a fan
So please come back no need to roam
Without your presence our house is not a home
And through it all I love you to the core
Ain’t no way in HELL that I can love you any more
So hold my hand and squeeze real tight
And let me love you baby, all through the night
[Chorus: El Debarge]
Wanna Love you, love you, baby
Love you yes I do
Wanna be the only one, the only one for you
I wanna be the only one
That holds and squeeze you tight
I wanna be the one you make love to every night
Wanna Love you, love you, baby
Love you yes I do
Wanna be the only one, the only one for you
I wanna be the only one
That holds and squeeze you tight
I wanna be the one you make love to every night
Wanna Love you, love you, baby
Love you yes I do
Wanna be the only one, the only one for you
I wanna be the only one
That holds and squeeze you tight
I wanna be the one you make love to every night"

Licking his lips while I was walkin'
Calling my name with a real big smile
'Cause I'm in his head with finesse and style
So he grabbed me by the arm and pulled me to the side
Said he'd be mine 'til the day I die
He told me he'll love me 'til the very end
Hey girl! I got your boyfriend!

Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man

When I first saw your man, he was really fine
He had a natural shake, it was so divine
He had a fresh Mercedes Benz that was dropped down low
Gold pin stripe, it was good to go
It had a Gucci rag top, with a system that thumped
[?] with a boom in the trunk
He kissed me on my cheek, and you know that's all he got
Now he calls me everyday saying, ""I love you a lot""
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man

And keep him in sight every single night
'Cause when I got out, I look so fine
'Cause I'm dressed to impress and I'm one of a kind
I'll take him, shake him, work him on out
Show your man what I'm all about
So when he tells you it's the end
That's when you know I got your boyfriend

As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
Happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

[Chorus:]
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please

[Verse 2:]
The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows
Searching for light
Going it alone
No comfort in sight

Hoping and praying
For someone who cares
Always moving But going nowhere
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I'm searching though
I don't succeed, no
For someone's love
There's a growing need

All is lost
There's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

[Chorus:]
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone who cares
I'll be looking every day
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now

I'll find a way somehow
Woo, hoo
I'll find a way somehow
What you've got to know is
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do the best I can, girl

Woo, hoo
I've gotta, gotta find her
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Gotta find a way somehow, sugar

(What becomes of the brokenhearted?)
I need love, baby
(Who had love that's now departed?)

I need you, darling
Oohh, whoa, yeah
I've gotta find a woman
Who is gonna love me, love me"

And I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others, then split
And if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (Yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
So I can manifest what I see on a drum beat
Like just last night (Yo, what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
One of them was quick to pull a knife
He stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
In prison at the age of twenty-one (Yeah)
Living on death row cause he couldn't let go
Caught in the web of violence (Damn)
Roll deep when they creep and move in silence of the lambs (Yo)

Should've listen to the Frost when I was trying to come across to you

You just keep getting yourself more deep until you sink
So there's no one else to thank but yourself
So go ahead take bow for a job well done
But you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times
Just the old days and your old ways
Corrupt and wicked
Out there doing dirt, instead of just kicking it
Pow pow, bang bang and all that noise (Yeah)
Yeah, you and all your homeboys
Take the time to read between the lines
Cause ain't no sunshine

[Hook: Prince Teddy]
Ain't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)
Ain't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)
Ain't no sunshine (Anytime, hey)
Ain't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)
Ain't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)
Ain't no sunshine, anytime

[Verse 3: Kid Frost]
(Yo, Kid) I know about being macho
Calling the shots the big time head honcho (Yeah)
But here's something even more gacho
One of my homeboys is your old lady's Sancho
Yo, shit happens
A number lights up on his beeper right as I'm rapping
While you sit in a cell writing a letter
Saying when you get out, your things will be better (Right)
But man she couldn't wait so she's going out on a date
With every Tom, Dick and Harry
And if you ask me, your shit's getting scary
So how you going to handle this
When your ho's in Los Angeles, acting so scandalous
Yo, you can't blame her you didn't take the time
And now, ain't no sunshine
[Hook: Prince Teddy]
Ain't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)
Ain't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)
Ain't no sunshine (That's for you, '92
You know what I'm saying?) Anytime, yeah
Ain't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)
Ain't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)
Ain't no sunshine, anytime (Damn)

[Outro Dialogue:]
So if you don't want to do no time
You better take time to try to draw the line
You know what I'm saying?
Or you're going to be the next fool in line doing time
You know what I'm saying?
Like my man said

Ain't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine fool)
Ain't no sunshine (Ain't nothing happening up there
You know what I'm saying?) Ain't no sunshine, anytime
(Yo, me and Frost is out of here, peace)

There just ain't no sunshine"

Mass hysteria, this is techno
House is not my home, but it rocks though
I checked up on the late great J.B
His death is said on national TV
How, when, and why these are the
Main things that I heard when I stroll down the lane
Of memory? Man, are you with that?

I'm confused, that things are gettin' hectic
In my brain, what is happenin'?
Could this be a big misunderstanding?
It is the hardest working man in show biz is alive
So, yo bust this — Don't be mislead
'cause the newsman said
James Brown is dead

Nightmare is over, now I'm awoke
Grab the mike, rip shit and go for broke

Now I will get much respect from MCs
Arrive the way, cause I heard him say
This is fly, this cool type of guy
He's dope, and oh so bad

(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)


[Verse 1: CL Smooth and Pete Rock]

I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back (Yeah)

Twenty-two years ago to keep it on track (Uh-huh)

The birth of a child on the 8th of October (It's like that)

A toast, but my granddaddy came sober

Countin' all the fingers and the toes

Now I suppose (Uh) you hope the little black boy grows (Yeah)

Huh, eighteen years younger than my mama (Mama)
But I rarely got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama (Yeah)
In single parenthood, there I stood (Huh?)
By the time she was 21, had another one (Yeah)
This one is a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first, but you don't give a damn (Alright)
Irresponsible, plain not-thinking (Yeah)

Papa said ""Chill"", but the brother keep winking (Uh-huh)
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide (Right)
On your side while the baby maker slide (Slide)
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married and a house
Listen, positive over negative for the woman and master
Mother Queen's rising a chapter

Déjà vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God
[Bridge 1: Pete Rock]
My God
It's so
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the '90s

Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha


[Verse 2: CL Smooth]
When I date back I recall a man off the family tree

My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father

When my biological didn't bother

Taking care of this, so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
Five kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese Lover at the age of 14

The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune

I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room

I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party

My old man standing, yelling ""Good God Almighty""
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real
[Bridge 2: Pete Rock]
For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha
In '92
Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me!

[Verse 3: CL Smooth]
I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of way-back,
so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint

Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street

But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes, in any weather

My Grandmom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Doc's the greatest, better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live 'cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, 'nough respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen
[Outro: Pete Rock]
Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin'
Everybody, just coolin'
This song we dedicate

To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble T-Roy

It's like that y'all
And you don't stop
Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92
And we out, later
(Just listen, listen, listen)
(Just listen, listen, listen)

See me and you hand in hand
That's how it used to be

The happy days
The times we shared
Without you, baby is so damn weird
Please forgive the things that I've done to you
I know I did a few
But baby, I'm human too

I'll take you to the beach where the wind blows
And let the waves and the sand run through your toes
Whatever you want
Whatever you
I'll plant the seed
But do you agree?
I should deal with that you have another man
But I can't understand
You're still wearing my wedding band
I'll just chill and think about the whole thing in the morning

I'll keep on brainstorming

I can't smell the breakfast that you used to cook, my dear

Some cold water on my face
So I can come to reality and realize it's me
My mind is not at ease since you've been gone
Please come back 'cause I'm so alone

P.S., yeah, you know been looking for you for the longest
Every since you left
But now I'm real independent you know
Just laid back chilling
I wanna let you know
You're really thought about every night and day
So I came up with these words
And had Boyz II Men sing 'em to you in the background
You know what I'm saying?
But I really want you back
So come back as soon as possible
Cause I love you

Then I bring `em, don`t even need bees when I sting` em
So check it, I bet you thought that I couldn`t wreck it
But I`m fat and when it`s time flow I handle that
Marky Mark and the Funk B`s slide Gs with ease over lordin` M.C.s
What up you sucker, feel strong? Think ya got it goin` on?
Chump`s moves are all wrong
It`s not a hoax, no jokes, I smokes mic`s, like a Phillie Blunt
Don`t ever try to front
And it`s quite absurd yo, word to herb
When your sleepin` on a Wahlberg
Step to this and I`m a break you down to the knees
So, you gotta believe

You gotta believe Better believe it
You gotta believe Yo better believe
You gotta believe Better believe it
You gotta believe You better believe

The double M got more kick comin` from my rhyme
And comin` from my 9, I rip it up on 2 or 3 times
Remember that still droppin` kids like bricks
While your hoe`s on tour tryin` to pull tricks
Gotta know this, doubt and your out for the count
Runnin` ruff rhymes keeps me paid in large amounts
Most of y`all got a problem, keep out my biz
And everything`ll be straight: `There it is`
But if not get a conflict, please no problem
I can handle that real quick
I got too many tricks up my sleeve
And I`m fully aware and prepared
So, you gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe"

And at the end of the night, no doubt, I'm gonna get mine

Recruiting suckers mackin' mic, and makin' men of 'em

You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't
Race for the border my daughter, 'cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out

Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
'Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown

wearing Godfather hats

It's okay to parlay to forte better

Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather

Swing another Rodney King thing and I'll wreck

But just like the white one I get no respect

Money stay awake, 'cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon, now your dumb ass is leakin'

Big time weight before Hammer got to touch it

Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces

I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not meant for a ho like a slow jam, check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D

Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be

The microphone is branded when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree

That I rock all the world and the society
Outrageous on the stages with a tune of verse
I give praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

Why don't you sit right back
And I, I may tell you a tale

A tale of three little pigs
And a big bad wolf

[Verse 1]
Well the first little piggy, well he was kinda hick-y
Spent most of his days just a-dreamin' of the city
And then one day, he bought a guitar
He moved to Hollywood to become a star
But living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city
Built his house out of straw, what a pity
Then one day, jammin' on some chords
Along came the wolf knocking on his door

[Chorus]
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!
[Verse 2]
Well the second little piggy, well he was kinda stoned
He spent most of his time just a-ganja smokin'
Hoppin' and a-boppin' down on Venice Beach
Getting paid money for religious speech
Built his shelter from what he garbage picked
Mostly made up of old cans and sticks
Then one day he was cranking up Bob Marley
Along came the Wolf on his big bad Harley

[Chorus]
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!

[Verse 3]
Well the third little piggy, the grade A student
His daddy was a rock star, named Pig Nugent

Earned his Master's degree from Harvard College
Built his house from his architect knowledge
A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills
Daddy's rock stardom paid for the bills
Then one day came the old house smasher
The big bad wolf, the little piggy slasher
[Chorus]
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!

[Verse 4]
Well the big bad wolf
Well he huffed, and he puffed, all that he could
And lo and behold, the little piggy's house stood
""It's made out of concrete,"" the little piggy shouted
The wolf just frowned as he pouted
So they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would
They sent out Rambo, just as fast as they could


[Rambo]
""Yo, Wolf-face. I'm your worst nightmare. Your ass is mine!""
(gunshots)

[Verse 5]
Well the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see
And that's the end of this story, for you and me
If you still give a listen, you just may
Hear the big wolf or little piggies say
[Chorus]
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!

If the shoe fits
I want you to wear it and wear it good

[Verse 1]
Talking 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be looking for somebody else
But, as time went on, I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind

[Chorus]
And so, you call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

[Verse 2]
Friends and enemies around me every day
I can't believe half the things they say
Taking me for granted giving no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncing like a bouncing ball
Everybody seems to disappear on me
Can't trust no one as far, as I can see
If I could be that fly that's on the wall
Listening to my friends talk about it all
[Chorus]
You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)

And I'm paying my own bills

Sons of Soul, y'all

I don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -

[Verse 3]
When I need somebody there's nobody to call
When they need me, my phone rings off the wall
But these are my friends, and that's what they say
Constantly taking from me every day
You say...

[Chorus]
You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)

So here it go!

Take a peek while I kick a Dr. Seuss mix
Ting-a-ling-a-boom! Ya pockets will they pick?
Shazam! Kick jam, the little rap
Suit to your tutu the middle rock flash!
Gobble... zuuuu gobbled up my lyric!
Hut for the double hut kid of the month!
Dag who touched the sweets to my all that
Tweedle dee, bumble bee, kick the funky def!
Who's gonna play? Back for show & tell
Too young to have a love so I call him fairy-tale
Marmaduke so I like her roots, so my love said
""Raven, this is what little girls are made of!""

That's what little girls are made of!

Well see I'm the rave, uh, the R-A-V-E-N
And when I start rhyming I can flow to the fin'
I can get laid back on ya knack paddy whack
Give a dog a mic and have some candy handy!
Roll 'em over, roll 'em over, bake them in a pan!
I'm the little girl who baked the ginger bread man, understand?
Diggy diggy dumb you understood and
You can thank me for showing Mike how to jam
Kris how to jump, Jordan how to dunk
En Vogue how to sing, Devante how to swing!

This is what girls are made of
Sugar spice and I'm the one who's nice
I got more rhymes than Cosby got shows!
Got more ""knows"" than Humpty got nose!
I support the women of zaggah, zaggah in my bag
I put my drawers in my hands so my pants won't sag-uh!

Reminisce, see if I can get with Mary B

Cause I'm not the one, not the one to play
But get your ball and ya bat cause this song is a hit!
If ya see what I see, then see what I bring!

Meetin' bitches, gettin' riches, miss me wit' lies!

Picture me livin' out my life as a busta

I'd rather pop out a shot from my Glock, and blast muthafuckaz!

I live the Thug Life, baby! I'm hopeless

Chokin' off indo, tryin' to keep my focus

Don't let that bullshit worry me

Fuck the fame! I'm true to the game 'til they bury me

Pour out some liquor for my niggas, 2Pac is still strugglin'!

Every time I pick up a mic and start spittin'
The sidewalks of New York will start bumpin'

Jumpin' around, wit' Tha muthafuckin' Pound

And I'm down to the fullest, and breakin' niggas ass off proper
Did I shock you? 'Cause I got you in my pocket again
Them new jacks and you jacks who knew me and my niggas
When I used to run it way back when (Way back when)
I boasted, and roasted, and coasted to the pinnacle
Because of what I do wit' a pen (Do with a pen)
It's vernacular precision
Connect the two lines and the division
Plus, when I add lutes and flutes
It's guaranteed to sell like prostitutes
I never had a love for hoes — to put it blunt
They want me in the back, but bitch, I'm in the front!
Don't front, and really, I don't need a reply
Pull yourself together as you pass me by
I'm on a whole another level, them hoes is left
I told you befo' — keep ya pussy to yourself

Goodbye! So many niggas lied to have
Funny what a muthafucka'd do for math
I got fractions caught up in my everyday actions
Point equal to your real satisfaction
Buckin' anybody who fuck wit' mine
When will they realize I'm straight out to get mine? Haha!

Yo Jef, why don't you give me a hoopa beat or something
Something I can go to the park to
Yeah, there you go, alright
I like that, I like that
It sound dope
Bust 'em in the eye, Shaq!

[Verse 1: Shaq]
You wanna fight? Come fight me!
I'll hit ya with the ""Wa-psh-psh-psh-psh-psh!"" See, see?
I get dirty after dark
I'll treat you like Spielberg, you'll get your ass kicked in in a park (Ooh!)

You don't believe me? The proof is in the puddin'
Been a boy in the hood way before Cuba Gooding

I flip scripts with the mad pa-style, freeze
(Shhh) Music, please!
I dribble rhymes like Basketball-em's
People call me E.T. (What's that, Shaq man?), Extra-Tallem's
You better than Shaq-tack, fool, shut up, liar!
I lean on the Statue of Liberty when I get tired

Than I'll punch you in the stomach, I don't give a heck
(Hey yo, why you booger hook like that?) Yo, she breath on my neck!
People walk around like, yo, they got charged!
But I'm big like Gorilla, 6'7 ain't large!

I kick rhymes like Moo Duk Kwan Do
I smoke-smoke the mic-mic like Cheech and Chong do

You don't like Shaq? Frankly, I don't give a damn
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man
[Verse 2: Def Jef]
Surprise, look who's back, not a prize from a Cracker Jack
Look at that, it's Def Jef with the Shaq Attack
Flexin', I'll be crackin your back with the boom-boom bap
Pass that mic over here, you ain't gon' want it back
Everybody say I got fat, yep, but so did my wallet
Still ripping rhymes and dropping bombs like Khalid Muhammad

Do yourself a solid, don't flex, you go sex
You know the time, get the high-hat, the Rolex
The way I see, if I was wack like you, I'd be at me
The way I hold it down, you'd swear my name was Gravity
Def Jef with the funk, Def Jef don't front, you know how the name is spelt
I'm making it vital, and jackin' the title, fool, break yourself
Attack the track like Shaq on a whack broad
Coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard

Don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk
The reason your tape ain't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump
So get back, ain't no hassle, cause you ain't holding nothin'
Keep sticking around, you get beat down like you stole something
Sleep on me and the Shaq and jump your own hand
Cause I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Ad-lib]
Ah yeah, yeah, y'all don't know nothing about this
The Shaq Man and The Arsenal
What's up like that?
Double XL in the nine-ohs kid
Skills to make mills
Big up, Flava Unit, Funky Town pros, upstate, yeah ??? ya large
So check this out Shaq man, we gon' let this beat play right here, let all
The brothers and sister know.....
[Verse 3: Shaq Diesel]
Nah, nah, let me continue
I'm a be like Pete Rock and see what's next on the menu

Mic-checka, the rim and rhyme wrecka, rocks from here to Mecca
(Boom!) Boom shack-a-lack-a-lack-a
I got a hand that'll rock ya cradle
Cream you like cheese, spread you on my bagel

My Ford Explorer boomin' with the trunk of funk
All you jealous punks can't stop my dunks

The brand new like Heavy, built like Chevy, Impala
But Shaq's a smooth balla
(Yeah, but what about rhymin'?) I can hold my own
Knick-knack, Shaq-attack, give a dog a bone

Rhymin is like hoopin', I'm already a legend

Back in the days in the food stamp section
Used to kick rhymes like, ""Baby, baby, baby!""
""Every once, every twice, three times a lady""

Is what I listened to, ridin' with my moms
How you like me now? I drop bombs!
When you see me, please tap my hands
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Outro: Shaq]
I'd like to give a shout-out to my boy Uzi, Def Jef, Little Swany, Meech
Ron Mac, and my other cousin Ron
This is another rough shot from the arsenal
And you know what? Booty rappers, stay booty

I'll do almost anything to get what I want
I might play any little game
Call me what you like but you know it's true

Now this ain't the name-calling game
See, I can refrain from using names to get fame
Since I'm known to create the kinds of beats
That make your rump shake, records are great
But now let's set the record straight
(They thought you was a sellout)
I'm sellin' out tours 'cause sellin' CDs, I'm the one MB
You wanna beat the G? I'll beat you like hizzos
In the backseat of my Caddy
You'll be callin' me Hammer Daddy
I'll work you like a slave, don't misbehave
You were gonna pay tax on one of my brothers' souls
Hit the street corner, caught up in your deuce
Since I refuse to forget that, alright, you talked tough
But face-to-face was a just a trick, bro
They put me in the mix, too legit to quit

I came wit' a long list of it
And in the future, you'll find me on the billboard
Or on the floor of the sign receiving music awards

To talk that talk, you gotta walk that walk
Oh, the Hammerman's talkin', so enter the dragon
And once you burned up those
That's caught in the diss Hammer bandwagon
Suckas, read Billboard and weep
You in the hot seat, where I'm from talk is cheap
And when I see ya, the styles you wrote, man
A mean left hook took ya out and it came from Oakland
Check it, you punks don't know me, a true OG
Yo, I was runnin' the whole scene
You started talkin' that mess
But I'm callin' your bluff, trick
I thought you knew
And boy, you still can't touch this

It's better than the average bro
I'm not the average Joe with the average flow
Yo, I can still do things that you wish you could
You're talkin' all that lip, but I don't even trip

Knock 'em to the ground and never ever let 'em up
But like a trick he might kick, I'll be prepared to red 'em up
However, if you wanna slang 'em, then we can get 'em up
Black Sheep, you're weak, you're meek
You're tryin' to grow feet
Dres, I make ya look head
But first, I'mma get your teeth

Talkin' about my mama's where I draw the line, Redman
Dancin' with the corners of yo dome
I'mma blow your mind, so!
Since I'm not the run of the mill
I feel the need to say you wanna be, you gotta be real
'Cause if ya ever come my way, like I used to say
Homeboy, you better pray just to make it today

I know what it is, the rat-a-tat piece of corny rhymes
You keep sayin' we don't find worth playin'
I don't feel like I'm a gangsta, so you claim that I'm a sellout
When we meet up on the street
Then we'll see who'll bail out

I was born three-six-seventy-two, I think it's on a Wednesday

Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte

That means I'm gifted from the get-go, Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro

You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince

Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys 'R' Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above

To go to the park, sweatin', push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me

Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me

Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I wanna be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, ""Good, now you gotta go
Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole""

Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, ""I can't let them down""
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna stop me, from being outstanding

[Interlude]
I'm outstanding
[Verse 2]
Now let's skip to the time when I was fifteen
Shaq is in the house, no, Shaq is on the scene
Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors
Kids look up to me like a skyscraper
Now, a role model, I mean a role figure
Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger?

My dream is coming true, but coming true slowly
Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me
""Remember this, son, you are the one not do all the runs
Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from
You're young, gifted, and Black
If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, Shaq!""
Like the fam do, in the stands too
When I freak the funk on a dunk they, ""Ah! Ooh!""
From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge
Make that gift and now it's time for me to fulfill my dream

To be in the [leaders' game?] like Hakeem

I'll make the backboards shatter

Fans chit-chatter
Even make the other centers get madder
That's me, who can it be?
The master of disaster, seven foot three
Brother, ain't no other in the nation
I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation
I'm outstanding
[Interlude]
I'm outstanding

[Verse 3]
'Cause now I'm outstanding
Wave your hands and pump your fist
When I'm on the court you know it's strictly, ""Swish!""
'Cause there's some things that I gotta do
Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq shoe
And now it's time to take care of business
To run up and down the court with Nick and Dennis
Scott, but I won't stop

Gotta keep striving until I reach the top
Gonna take a peek over the mountain
I flow like a fountain
Peace, I gotta go! And I'm out and
But before I go, wave your hands
Peace to all my family, friends and fam
I'm outstanding

I thought I knew you, thought that I knew you well
We had a rhythm, but I guess you never can tell
Oh, I learned early never to ignore the signs
You'll be forgiven
It ain't worth that much to my mind
Loving you (Was) so easy, it's hard to say goodbye
But if it's the way it goes it goes

Loving somebody ain't your average nine to five
It takes conviction; it takes a will to survive
I'm not somebody who commits the crime
And leaves the scene
But when I've been dissed
I don't spend much time on what might've been
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
Now I'm movin', movin' on

And you're not on my mind
Am I too close to time to get over you?
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm moving on (And on, and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries (Just another page)
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You're seriously misled
Just a page in my history

And I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely

Untouchable memories, seem to keep haunting me
Of a love so true
That it once turned all my gray skies blue

But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
And I'm wishing you were here with me

Soaked with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, I just don't know what to do

If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine and once again
You'd be mine all mine

But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me

Girl, I don't know what I did
To make you leave me but what I do know
Is that since you've been gone
There's such an emptiness inside

I want to dedicate this song to Philip Arthur Harrison

Word up
Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother


[Verse 1]
Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from Newark to Jersey City
Woman and child alone, now that's pressure

Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door

Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother
[Hook]
Took me from a boy to a man
So I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother (4x)

Phil is my father

[Verse 2]
January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort Monmouth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" like Clark Gable

Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and thats the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get them good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could understand but I'm glad you did it
Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother
(chorus)

[Verse 3]
Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur

And if you're making big dope be materialistic
Cause you'll end up another statistic
Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I want the ring like Hakeem

Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money

What people do for money!!!

It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

I'm looking back through the years
Down this highway
Memories; they all lead up to this one day
And many dreams lost along the way
Haunt me still
I guess they always will
When love was too much to bear
I just left it there
Here I stand, face to face
With this heart of mine
Livin' without you I only fall behind
We had a love most people never find
All this time
I never realized
And the courage I finally found
Has made me turn around

[Chorus]
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me
[Verse 2]
I can still hear the song of your laughter
I can still taste the sorrow of your tears
We said ""Goodbye"", but our hearts did not hear
Now, my love, there's nothing left to fear
With all my heart put me through
It leads me back to you

There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'

Deprived of all the things
She misses, wants, wishes and needs
Got hotter than a hundred-and-three
She turned and said to me
[Chorus]
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low
(Keep it on the down low)
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low, oh oh
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low
Oh oh, oh oh oh, keep it on the down low
Oh oh, oh oh oh, keep it on the down low

[Bridge]
I wouldn't treat you that way
If you were my lady
I wouldn't share you
You'd be mine and mine alone, oh yeah
If he continues wastin' your time
Girl, he's crazy
(I'll take her)
Try to hang on, Max
[Verse 3]
Maxine looked into my eyes
Wanted me to be the other guy
'Cause tonight she's needin' someone to hold
Lonely nights can be, oh, so cold
He thinks that she's content
'Cause he bought her car and pays her rent
But she's not ready to leave
She turned and said to me

[Chorus]
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low, oh
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low, oh
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low, oh oh
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low
Oh oh, oh oh oh, keep it on the down low
Oh oh, oh oh oh, keep it on the down low

Howlin' on the wind

Up up against your door

The keeper of the flame
Don't give me money money money
It'll lead my soul astray
I just wanna be inside your temple
Each and every day
When you lay down your head
I will be your bed
And I'll be the heart
That keeps on a-beatin'
Hard up against your skin
I'll be the bulldozer pushin'
'Til you let me in
And when the sun goes down
I will be around

Someday you'll know my name
Long as our love is in the rain

To get what I wanna get
I'll be the red red wine
Going straight to your head

All I'll be the train

Up up around the bend
I'll be the horse that keeps on rockin'
This ride will never end
O when the sun goes down
I will be around

Ever since you went away
I just haven't been the same
Tell me why you left me in the rain yesterday

Twenty-four hours went by
Without you by my side
My life is upside down
How could I be so blind?
If only I could erase
All the times I made you cry, girl
You say you never miss your water 'til your well runs dry

[Chorus]
Ever since you went away
I just haven't been the same
Tell me why you left me in the rain yesterday
(Ever since you went away)
Ever since you went away
I just haven't been the same
Tell me why you left me in the rain yesterday

[Verse 2]
I'm just sitting here trippin'
Waiting for you to call
I guess I should have known better
Than to ever do you wrong
If only I can turn a page
Thinking back to yesterday
I promise I'm gonna change
It seems like nothing really matters to me
(Nothing really matters)
'Cause with you is where I want to be, ho-oh-oh-oh
Just give me one more chance
Maybe we can work it out
I don't care what people say
They don't know what you're about

Ever since you went away
I just haven't been the same
Tell me why you left me in the rain yesterday

If you come back to me
I'll give you all
The love that you need
Baby, come back to me
'Cause I know now
You are my everything, everything
Something about you
Really turns me on
You are my everything, everything
Something about you
Really turns me on
You are my everything

Ever since you went away (Went away)
I just haven't been the same
Tell me why you left me in the rain yesterday

Ever since you went away
(Look what you've done to me)
I just haven't been the same
Tell me why you left me in the rain yesterday
Ever since you went away

I just haven't been the same

Tell me why you left me in the rain yesterday
Ever since you went away

Peaches come from a can, they were put there by a man
In a factory downtown
If I had my little way, I'd eat peaches every day
Sun-soakin' bulges in the shade

I took a little nap where the roots all twist, squished a rotten peach in my fist
And dreamed about you, woman
I poked my finger down inside, make a little room for an ant to hide
Nature's candy in my hand or can or a pie

We can talk until dawn

There's no one to hear
You might as well scream
They never woke up
From the American dream
And they don't understand
What they don't see
And they look through you
And they look past me
Oh... you and I dancing slow
And we got nowhere to go

Past the Wal-Mart and the prison
Down by the old V.A

Just my jeans and my T-shirt
My blue Chevrolet
Well, it's Saturday night
It feels like everything's wrong
I've got some strawberry wine
I want to get you alone
Get you alone
'Cause there's no one to hear
You might as well scream

And they don't understand
What they don't see
And they look through you
And they look past me
Oh... you and I dancing slow
And we got nowhere to go

Down by the muddy water
Of the mighty Mo

In an old abandoned box car
Will I ever know
Dance with me forever
This moment is divine
I'm so close to heaven
This hell is not mine
This hell is not mine

But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and
)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)

[Verse 1: Warren G]
I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
He mistaked me for somebody who was liable
To more than many murders
LA's a war fields

We keep making war shields
Streets keep souls
Young brothers lose control
I seem to maintain through this
Watch where you kick it they'll put you in a twist
And it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie
And tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
They do crime and attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

You know who
The boys in blue

There they go with they assumpitons
Slaverys over let us have somethin'
Why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
My profession is music
Your profession is protection with gats

Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

[Verse 3: Warren G]
I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you
And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
They harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
The hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
Cuz I'm gonna work for life
So he can see another day
A hommies a hommie
A fake is a snake
Straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

When I'm tired

We were in a room with sunshine in my eyes

And water on the floor
I watched you float away
Take me with you

We were walking around
We were fooling around
In the garden
In the garden

I saw you turn around
And still you turn around
My eyes are playing tricks on me
How I miss you

I could be your lover
Chained under the water
Under the water
I could be standing on a ladder
To make it easier
To make it easier

Your eyes are colored stone
You've got an earring
Through your nose

Your chains are made of gold
I don't think they would float
But floating is what you do
That is beautiful
That is you

I could be your lover
Chained under the water

I could be swimming out to save you

As the fuel goes down
Stops the car
Puts her feet outside in the rain
She's back on the machine
But it's sweet so far away

[Verse 1]
She feels the ground is giving way
But she thinks we're better off that way
""The more you take, the less you feel
The less you know, the more you believe

The more you have, the more it takes today""

[Chorus]
You gotta give it away (You gotta give it away)
You gotta give it away (You gotta give it away)
You gotta give it away (You gotta give it away)
Well, she don't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth

[Verse 2]
She's not waiting on a saviour to come
She's at the bus stop
With the News Of The World
And the sun, sun, here it comes

She's not waiting for anyone
[Chorus]
You gotta give it away (You gotta give it away)
You gotta give it away (You gotta give it away)
You gotta give it away (You gotta give it away)
Well, she don't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth

[Bridge]
(Clock tells her that time is slipping)
Slipping away
(Tear drop sunshine)
Slip slide
(Two sides to one feels missing)
Too many
(Something she might be missing)
Slipping away
(The world turns and we get dizzy)
The world turns and we get dizzy
(Spinning for you the way it's spinning for me)
Slipping away

[Verse 3]
She's living, living next week now
You know she's gonna pay you back somehow
She hasn't been to bed in a week
She'll be dead soon, then she'll sleep
[Chorus]
You gotta give it away (You gotta give it away)
You gotta give it away (You gotta give it away)
You gotta give it away (You gotta give it away)
She already knows it hurts
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth
Last night on earth
Last night"

We used to chase that boy home from school

He was different, he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
But we never left well enough alone
Then one day he ran away from home you see

[Pre-Chorus]
And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

[Chorus]
One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're gonna love me

Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should have seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at 17 you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away
[Pre-Chorus]
And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering

[Chorus]

And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little

Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singing
The moment that I learn

One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
And then I'm gonna smile a little
And maybe even laugh a little

[John Forté - Verse 1]
Yo...yo...
Hustle big, hustle small
All y'all relate to it
I'm a a culture power, baby, when I run right through it
What the biz, money? You know John and what it is
But then again too many yes-men...
(Wyclef: ""Yo John, they missed it."")
Hustle big, hustle small
All y'all relate to it
I'm a a culture power, baby, when I slide right through it
What the biz, money? You know John and what it is
Then again too many yes-men inside the business
We stay grungy
Risk take on streets like a bungee
Hoes get nothing from me
I'm-a die feeling hungry
Rappers too complacent
I make hits in the basement

Got all the men on top wondering where they placement
If it's real, then it's real
And it ain't no replacement
Them jealous cats who talk need to all walk adjacent
I trifold y'all all into a image my mold
So I can teach you how to walk, eat, drink, and buy gold
My shit is iz-ill
Wear three condoms out in Brazil
Brothers from the 'ville no fault at the iz-ill
Wanna have a duke? Get real! How you fiz-eel?
You couldn't stick me if you brought the chisel
What the diz-eal?
Eat four stars at every miz-eal
You kiz-ill the vibe
You just high from the twiz-ill
And sti-zill I flow riz-ill, leave you fiz-ill
And leave y'all all stuck like Jack from without the Jiz-ill
What?

I shoot the gift cop
Find John at the strip spot
Juggling three who all know to keep their lips locked
I don't get got
I told y'all before: it's hot
Fuck the floss
I'm the boss when I rock flip-flops
Culture hip-hop
Before I take your head you should skip bop
Or find us in your homes with the chrome and the shits cocked
What?
Hey y'all pose hard, but they rip up
I leave them enemies with their lips shut
Did what?
Yo money ease up how you cease us
You better off reefin' lighting trees up
Smoking with your mens fantasizing something swiftly
But little did you know I had the whole country with me

Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes

She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes

Caught you checking my pager
If I was cheating
I would have erased it

Must everywhere you go be on the down low?
If you wasn't creeping
Tell me why

If I told you
You’d say it was untrue
I keep denying
Sick of trying
Maybe I should lie to you

Thought men were all the same
But I never gave up hope
And now my life has changed
Listen to me, girls
One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl

He always treats me right
We never fight
He sends me flowers
And wines and dines me
Took me home to meet his mama
How he loves me
One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Give it one more try

We bout to spit hospitable
Physical, but shit is gettin critical
The way cats bitin' is despicable
Pitiful, unoriginal, this shit is miserable
I'm a businessman, I ain't tryin to be lyrical
Damn it's a miracle, thought y'all was veterans
Wish your flow was ill huh?
Mine was your medicine

Now you're in the game
Lame sound the best you've ever been
Play right I'll catch you late night nigga like Letterman
Get thirty thou now your actions begun
Actin and fun nigga after taxes you're done
Cars impounded, New York must stop bitin' and start writin'
And start mountin'
When the fuck we start bouncin'?

We stash ounces, make a nigga start clownin
We spark round and nigga that's your heart poundin'

Yo I get dough any way

Yo you rap about money, man, who are you anyway?

C'mon, all my jewels ice and gray
And nigga might I say

Any beef you let me know, I'll be there right away
And when I'm rhyming, I've always got the right of way
I got some cats that'll come down here right away
To take your ass right away
Believe me you could die today
We explode and bullets we reload and killers speak in code
So please let me know

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at 13, an ebony queen

Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
""What would you do if it was you?""
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain

Lord, come and take me
Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief

Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
‘Cause they win when your soul dies
[Hook: 2Pac & H.E.A.T.]
Baby please don't cry!, you got to keep your head up

Forget him, girl, he ain't gon' never change
I ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin' mo'
And never your feelings, he's chasin' millions for sho'
Uh oh, now you 'bout to have his baby?
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much mo' livin' to do – I'm spittin' this to you
‘Cause you deserve more than what he givin' to you
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she

Got 'em all stuck standin' still when she come through
Baby, take a little mo' time, love will find you
And sho' as the sky's blue somebody other than me
Gon' give you everythin' you need, feel me? (Don't cry-ahh…)

I'm tryin' to do all that I can
From jump, now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you?
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homie roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those ain't my seeds, nothin' really I could do
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Should've chose me, she 'bout to OD from the pressure
Hell nah, I won't let her (BABY..)

Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club

Both active in the FFA

After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

[Verse 2]
Well, it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise

Well, she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care


[Pre-Chorus]
Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta

On a red-eye midnight flight

She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
[Chorus]
That Earl had to die

Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted alright to me, Earl

You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?

Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?


[Verse 3]
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low

Then they tipped their hats

And said ""Thank you ladies, if you hear from him let us know,""

[Verse 4]
Well, the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

[Pre-Chorus]
So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109

They sell Tennessee ham

And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause
[Chorus]
Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break

Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl

Hey

[Outro]
Well hey, hey, hey
Aw, hey, hey, hey
Well hey, hey, hey"

Broadway's dark tonight

A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die


[Verse 1]
The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far

The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls

Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world like it's someplace that you've been


[Pre-Chorus 1]
You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

[Chorus]
Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die
[Verse 2]
You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you sober up for fun

Your anger don't impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell on the loser's day parade


[Pre-Chorus 1]
You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you're thinking you're a joke and nobody's going to listen
To the one small point I know they've been missing around here

[Chorus]
Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die

You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July

Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands
Here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
It looks like spring and
It feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July

Get a dick suck wit a gat in my hand

When I saw you standin' there
Close enough to touch
Breathin' the same air
You asked me how I'd been
I guess that's when I smiled and said just fine
Oh, but baby I was lyin'

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

And as you walked away
The echo of my words
Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held on to my pride and watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know
What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you

What I really meant to say
Is I'm really not that strong
No matter how I try

I'm so scared that the way that I feel is written all over my face
When you walk into the room
I wanna find a hiding place
We used to laugh
We used to hug
The way that old friends do

But now a smile
And a touch of your hand just makes me come unglued
It's such a contradiction
Do I lie or tell the truth?
Is it fact or fiction?
Oh, the way I feel for you

[Chorus]
It's so complicated
I'm so frustrated
I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away
I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay
Should I say it?
Should I tell you how I feel?
Oh, I want you to know, but then again I don't
It's so complicated


[Verse 2]
Just when I think I'm under control
I think I finally got a grip
Another friend tells me that my name is always on your lips
They say I'm more than just a friend
They say I must be blind
Well, I admit that I've seen you watch me
From the corner of your eye
Oh, it's so confusing
Yeah, I wish you'd just confess
But think of what I'd be losing
If your answer wasn't yes

[Chorus]

I hate it
Cause I've waited so long for someone like you
What do I do?

It was about five until five on Friday
We were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show
He said you and you come with me
Cause you're going to have to stay
My heart was thumping I was jumping
I had to get away

[Chorus]
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

[Verse 2]
Well I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
He asked the loaded question
It seems unreal to me that
He said how do you feel about me
My mind was racing I was pacing
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing
Left to do I feel it coming on
[Chorus]
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

You got to loosen up those chains and dance
Come on and loosen up those chains and dance"

To the east side (We're movin' on up)
We finally got a piece of the pie

Watch these grown men get it, know fo' sho'
Yo, get your back up off the wall and get your feet on the floor
You see the boy at the bar wit the glass so tall
When I'm done baby dogg I'ma show you Baltimore
Right now we gon' party, Bacardi give me some more
It's off the rack the club packed, I'm two-cut like two doors
Of course I do my two-step, I give 'em too much
I mustered up bad, I drop ashes in my cup
I had enough they throwin' bows, see they swingin and shit
I got my arm around this smut dame, puttin' in work
Before we merk I got to book somethin'
So baby stop frontin'
I got the drink and the smoke
Ain't got to buy nothin'
Not bluffin, it's goin' down understand me
I like my birds nasty, I burst in them cashmeres
Everything, and you know what I came for
Right now it's goin' down, let me on the dance floor

Whoa now, that's what the old heads say
I party like it's my birthday, drinkin and still thirsty
Whoa now, shorty give me what you got
The spot kinda live and I see you gettin hot

I came to shake a load off, so take your coat off
Mixed drinks what you think, OJ and Smirnoff
I sip it all - hey, what can I say
See I just got paid so I'm feelin' the swig and I'm tryin' get laid
I'm buyin' drinks and they love it
Divas growin' cheaper
Gucci bag Gucci bucket
Takin' shots from my cousin
He don' know how to act
Came straight out the woods
And the club wit a sack
Like what you know no good
But I know I pimp nasty
Sneakers is off the meter
You can't help wit the clap
Can't help but the boogie
Get loose but don't push me
We came so deep
And we're all wearin' hoodies
All my eighty-dime soldiers
What you doin' tonight
Now, put yo eight-dimes up
You made enough for the night
Let's take a break
Let's spend some cake
You ain't enjoyin' your life
Yo, we been workin' all week
So we gon' do it tonight

All my east-side boys put ya guns up
Pull out the knife cuz we gon' party till the law comes

They throwin gang signs; see, I'm throwin' W's (Westside)
I'm screamin 80 dimes, I swear to God it's goin down

Daddy sits on a front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My Brothers found work in Indiana
M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I’ve been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone

Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when

Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I’m gonna be a star

[Verse 3]
Now, me and Deliah singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin’
But the music ain't got no soul

Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard

They've got money but they don't have Cash

They got Junior but they don't have Hank

No, I ain't honked the horn since I don’t know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

I don't need to think because I just know
That baby it's the way you love me

Don't you know that I've waited for you
You are everything I've wanted all my life
Never thought I would find what I need
Till you came along my dreams seemed so far away

I could be with another girl
And I can take a trip all around the world
But why would I go anywhere when I've got you
I could spend my money on fancy clothes
Meet a thousand women doing videos and shows
But baby I'm so glad that I got you

Maybe I just got lucky
Because a chance like this don't come along every day
And can we hold on to what we've got
If I ever lost you girl, my whole life would change

You should know that your life gives me strength
And without you I don't know where I would be
It's because of your shoulder I'm at ease
No matter where I am I'm not alone. eh

I think about you when the night is cold and dark, uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you, oh

[Chorus]
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)

I drove all night

[Bridge]
I taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright (Is that alright?)
I drove all night

Headboard bang, bump the side of ya head
Watch how ya ass spread spill all off the side of the bed now, hmm

And make you jump inside the whip and smoke a blunt with yo' ass

And bag all the bitches, now watch you see me zip in a flash

Bust right through the window then it sit on the dash
And have a nigga drivin' reckless 'til you makin' him crash

They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy

My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, e'rybody gotta watch me

And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
Long as the VS bling, look at that light show

In the hood they say, ""50, man, your sneaker look right yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho""

So the stash box big enough to squeeze the MAC in, yeah
I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
Cause I already wear your advance on my neck

I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers

I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers

When it comes to stunting there's nothing you could teach us

With a letterman's jacket and a chevrolet
Thought I was cool
Yea, I ruled the school
You were cumlada with the strawberry lips
Had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips
Your senior year, and I was your daddy's worst fear

We ran off on graduation night
Thought a couple of left-hand rings would make everything alright

Chorus:
With a little bita live, little bita learn
Little bita watchin' a few more candles burn and
Finding out what life was
Oo with a little bita fuss, little bita fight
Littel bita kiss and makin' up all night and
One day waking up
Oh in a real love

Well I was 22 working double overtime
I was spending dollars and making dimes
We were overdrawn, yea and barely hanging on
Then one night you came to me
With tears in your eyes and an EPT and said
""Guess what? Yea baby ready or not""
I just smiled but I was scared to death
How am I gonna have a kid when I'm still a kid myself?

Woah in a real love
Yeah yeah
Its a real love

Yeah baby its a real love
Yeah its a real love baby
Yeah its a real, real, real, real, real, real love

Birdman, put them niggas in a trash can
Leave 'em outside of your door, I'm your trashman

I'm steady lighting up the hash, and, riding in my Jag
You will need a gas mask, man

You snakes, stop hiding in the grass
Sooner or later I'll cut it, now the blade's in your ass

You homo niggas getting AIDS in the ass

While the homie here tryna get paid in advance

I'm staying on my grizzy, I'm a bona fide hustler
Play me or play with me, then I'm gonna find your mother
Niggas wanna eat, 'cause they ain't ate nothin'
But niggas wanna leave when you say you out of mustard

So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone
Leaving out, leaving behind just residue and bones
In your residence with Rugers to your dome
Like, ""Where the fuck you holding the coke?""
Holding your throat, choke

Another summer day has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome, but I wanna go home, mmm
Maybe surrounded by a million people, I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

[Verse 1]
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
""I'm fine, baby, how are you?""
Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another aeroplane, another sunny place
I'm lucky, I know, but I wanna go home
Mmm, I got to go home

[Chorus]
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home


[Verse 2]
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
That this was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day
has come and gone away
In either Paris or Rome, and I wanna go home
Let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people, I
I still feel alone
Oh, let me go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

I gotta go home

To a half a million fans screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game

She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon
Ride around the world
No, she's just your everyday average girl

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned-up knee
A little kiss is all she needs

The keeper of the Cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
Bedtime stories every night
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

She didn't get a check
Every week like a nine-to-fiver
But she's been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver
For twenty years there at home
Until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition
But now her baby's moving on
And she'll soon be missing her
But not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest

It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
She walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

Thirty years have flown right past
Her daughter's staring at
All the photographs of her mother
And she wishes she could be like that
Oh but she already is

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home
She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero"

Grab that cologne out my bookbag, I smell dro all on you, homes

Suppose the po-po's get whiff of the spliff that you just smoked, them folk gon' trip

Probable cause, call the canine unit to the side of the road, let's take a sniff

Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is this UGK CD, Tackleberry
So may we be on our merry way?
'Cause you just ain't gon find no yay

Play, I got a tough team of attorneys
Make a judge lean like he sipping syrupy
They play dirty, he can't touch me
Verdict be not guilty, search me

""Can't you just get over it?""
It turned my whole world around

With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger

And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

Amor mío
Si estoy debajo del vaivén de tus piernas
Si estoy hundido en un vaivén de caderas
Esto es el cielo, es mi cielo

Amor fugado
Me tomas, me dejas, me exprimes y me tiras a un lado
Te vas a otros cielos y regresas, como los colibríes
Me tienes como un perro a tus pies

[Pre-Coro]
Otra vez mi boca insensata
Vuelve a caer en tu piel
Vuelve a mí tu boca y provoca
Vuelvo a caer de tus pechos a tu par de pies

Labios compartidos
Labios divididos, mi amor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios
Y comparto el engaño
Y comparto mis días y el dolor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios
Oh, amor
Oh, amor compartido
[Verso 3]
Amor mutante
Amigos con derecho y sin derecho de tenerte siempre
Y siempre tengo que esperar paciente
El pedazo que me toca de ti

[Verso 4]
Relámpagos de alcohol
Las voces solas lloran en el sol (Eh!)
Mi boca en llamas torturada
Te desnudas angelada
Luego te vas

Otra vez mi boca insensata
Vuelve a caer en tu piel de miel
Vuelve a mí tu boca, duele
Vuelvo a caer de tus pechos a tu par de pies

Labios compartidos
Labios divididos, mi amor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios
Y comparto el engaño
Y comparto mis días y el dolor
Ya no puedo compartir tus labios
Que me parta un rayo
Que me entierre al olvido, mi amor
Pero no puedo más compartir tus labios
Compartir tus besos
Labios compartidos
Uh-oh yeah!

Te amo aunque estés compartida

First in my class here at MIT

Got skills, I'm a champion at D&D

M.C. Escher—that's my favorite ""M.C.""

Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea

My rims never spin, to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary

All of my action figures are cherry

Stephen Hawking's in my library

My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin' for my Top 8 spaces

Yo, I know pi to a thousand places

Ain't got no grills, but I still wear braces

I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise

I'm a whiz at Minesweeper—I could play for days

Once you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze

There's no killer app I haven't run (Run)

At Pascal, well, I'm number one (One)

Do vector calculus just for fun

I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun (What?)

""Happy Days"" is my favorite theme song

I could sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong

I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on

I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon

Here's the part I sing on
[Chorus]
They see me roll on my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm white and nerdy

Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy

I'd like to roll with the gangstas
Although it's apparent I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy?


[Verse 2]
I've been browsin', inspectin'
X-Men comics, you know I collect 'em

The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em

My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored

Shopping online for deals on some writable media

I edit Wikipedia

I memorized Holy Grail really well
I can recite it right now and have you ""ROTFLOL""

I got a business doing websites
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all
Even made a homepage for my dog, yo

I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin' a sale down at The Gap

Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop, pop, hope no one sees me, gettin' freaky

I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
I was in AV Club
and Glee Club
and even the Chess Team

Only question I ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?

Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair

Got my name on my underwear
[Chorus]
They see me strollin', they laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy!

I wanna bowl with the gangstas

But, oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy"

I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

[Bridge]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be movin' on
If you don't
If you won't

[Chorus]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete, oh-oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I'm right beside you, a dreamer you can do without
I know you well, but we've never met
Always the same, always the safe bet

I know what's happening, I've seen it before
Uninvited, I'll be coming to your back door
Lock all your windows, hide under your bed
I hear you breathing, I know you're there

You can turn off the light
You can turn off your mind
You can shut me out

But I'll still be here
I'll still be here
You can turn me off and try to shut me down
But I'll still be here

You want to see things all the same
Why don't you see things in color for a change
I'm waiting and listening, trying to walk in your shoes
They walk a straight line, such a straight line

I'll drop my fences, if you drop your guard
Meet me on the front porch stop hiding in your backyard
Unlock your windows, come out from the bed
Your tv's glowing, I know you're there
You can turn it around
Til you like how it sounds
You can turn me off

But I'll still be here
I'll still be here
You can turn me down but I'll just shout it out
I'll still be here

Who did away with empathy
How do you love without sympathy
And who will be the one that still believes

It's the powerless who seem to fall
Between the cracks of those who have it all
And who's gonna be the one to speak for me

I'll still be here
I'll still be here
(repeats with Martie and Emily harmonies)

I'll still be here
When you like it or not
Oh I'll be here

When you think I forgot

Come out in your backyard Monday
Let's meet on your front porch Friday

I'll still be here

And I heard you almost cuss
And I fought back the urge to laugh
Just listen to you fuss
Then you overdid the coffee
Couldn't get your hair just right
When I smiled and said good morning
You looked mad enough to fight

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in a love with too
Yeah, that minivan's a far cry
From the sports car in your dreams
And that dead end job is pushing back
Vacation more, it seems
You got soccer at four-thirty
And ballet class by five
Then I call you talking flirty
You ask have I lost my mind

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too

When you lay down in my arms
Let go of all that stress
Whisper, honey I love you
With your head on my chest
When the world's strongest woman is my lady
When the day is through
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
If I had to do the things you do
Well, I'd just lose my mind
Somehow you get 'em fed and bathed
And settled down by nine
And I hear you down the hallway
As you're laying down to sleep
And pray the good lord watches
Over them and you and me

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too"

Don't wanna be alone tonight
On this planet they call Earth
You don't know about my past, and
I don't have a future figured out
And maybe this is going too fast
And maybe it's not meant to last

What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay
What do you say?

I just wanna start again (I just wanna start again)
And maybe you could show me how to try
Maybe you could take me in (Take me in)

Baby girl got a thang for me

I'm all on her back, when she move like that
You can find me where every she at, Like that

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me


[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed


[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl

I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her

When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

Tired from the fight
I've been fighting for tomorrow

Yea I woke up this morning
Feeling brand new
'Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Have finally come true

It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day

It's been a long time coming
Up the mountain kept runnin'
Souls of freedom kept hummin'
Channeling Harriet Tubman

Kennedy, Lincoln, and King
We gotta invest in that dream
It feels like we're swimming upstream
It feels like we're stuck in between
A rock and a hard place
We've been through the heartaches
And lived through the darkest days
If you and I made it this far
Well then hey, we can make it all the way
And they said no we can't
And we said yes we can
Remember it's you and me together

I woke up this morning
Feeling alright
I've been fightin' for tomorrow
All my life
Yea, I woke up this morning
Feeling brand new
Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Have finally came true

It's a new day
(it's a new day)
It's a new day
(it's a new day)
It's a new day
It's a new day!

It's been a long time waitin'
Waiting for this moment
Been a long time praying
Praying for this moment
We hope for this moment
And now that we own it
For life I will hold it
And I ain't gonna let it go

It's for fathers, our brothers
Our friends who fought for freedom
Our sisters, our mothers
Who died for us to be in this moment

Stop and cherish this moment
Stop and cherish this time

It's time for you and me
For us and we
That's you and me together

I woke up this morning
Feeling brand new
Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Have finally came true
Yea, I woke up this morning
Feeling alright

'Cause we weren't fighting for nothing
And the soldiers weren't fighting
For nothing
No, Martin wasn't dreaming for nothing
And Lincoln didn't change it for nothing
And children weren't crying for nothing
It's a new day
It's a new day
A new day
It's a new day
It's a new day!"

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome

A violence-prone poor-people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam

Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest, survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

Bringin' us promises, leavin' us poor

We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us

It's makin' my brain delirious

Dressin' it down, hittin' on dudes hard

Stockings ripped all up the side
Lookin' sick and sexy-fied
So let's go-o-o, let's go

We are who we are

We're dancin' like we’re dumb, dumb, d-d-d-dumb

Dying in the process

Buy yourself the motivation, generation nothing

I am not the singer that you wanted, but a dancer

I refuse to answer

Wrote it for the ones who want to get away

Keep running!

[Verse 1]
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near

Every time you touch me, I just melt away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smilin' out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a little work)
Oh, woah
Nothin's perfect, but it's worth it
After fightin' through my tears
And finally, you put me first

[Chorus]
Baby, it's you (Oh)
You're the one I love (I love)
You're the one I need (I need)
You're the only one I see

Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call (Always calls)
When I need, you make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh), come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top, my love on top

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby
I can feel the wind whippin' past my face
As we dance the night away (Away)
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smilin' out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a little work)

There's ups and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, hey

Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain (Chain)

Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change

My girls can't tell me nothin', I'm gone in the brain

I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time

Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten

It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Verse 2]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots

Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Verse 3]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon, the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Sure it's Christmas once more"

Shake that body, party that body

Come and have a good time with G-O-D (Hey)

I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
""New God Flow,"" fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella

They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay' as a wholesaler (Hey)

I think it's good that Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him (Yuugh)
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us

Goin' HAM in Ibiza done took a toll on us (Woo)
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I'm goin' four-door (Woo)

Step on they necks 'til they can't breathe
Claim they five stars, but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see

Fuck 'em, 'Ye, fuck 'em, 'Ye
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier (Woo)
They shit is shoppin' at Targét (Woo)
My shit is luxury Balmain (Hey)

I'm balling, Amar'e
A nick' sold in the park, then I want in
What's a king without a crown, nigga? (What?)
What's a circus without you clown niggas? (Ha)
What's a brick from an out of town nigga
When you flood and you can drown niggas? (Yuugh)
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman

Went from most hated to the champion god flow

I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know
I'm living three dreams
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's, uh
'Cause we can't get along, no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw, man, you sold your soul
Nah, man, mad people was frontin'
Aw, man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you

What has the world come to? I'm from the 3-1-2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true

Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
Forty killings in a weekend, forty killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chain?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
""I'm on fire, ayy,"" that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah & Kanye West]
Shake that body, party that bod— (Yo)
Shake that body, party that bod— (Stop)
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

What of the dollar you murdered for?
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
Or your brother's the one that you're running from?
But if you got money, fuck it, ‘cause I want some

B-I-G

Who fuckin' with me?
Oh, God!
Woah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muhfuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique

And all these bad bitches, man, they want the-
They want the-, they want the-
(B-I-G, oh God

Go

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say (Yup)
My block behind me, like I'm coming out the driveway (Swerve)

It's grind day, from Friday to next Friday (Woah)
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day (Spa day)

Yup, she try and gimme that poon-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang (Woah)

I'm rollin' with, ha, fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Skrrt! I'm pullin' up in that Bruce Wayne

But I'm the fuckin' villain, man, they kneelin' when I'm walking in the buildin'

Freaky women I be feelin' from the bank accounts I'm fillin'
What a feelin'! Ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D
that's killing everything that he see for the dough
[Chorus: Big Sean]

Okay, ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique

G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin
, ain't nothin' fuckin' with we

Two-fifty to a half a, man, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me

Now, who with me? ¡Vámonos!
Call me Hov or Jefe

Translation: I'm the shit, 'least that what my neck say
'Least that what my check say,
lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like twelve years, ain't hug his son since the second grade
Uh, he never told—who he gon' tell?
We top of the totem pole

It's the Dream Team
meets the Supreme Team

And all our eyes green, it only means one thing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Break records at Louis,
ate breakfast at Gucci

My girl a superstar all from a home movie

Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols

What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel

Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented

You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy eighty gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish

Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse

He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews

Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence

Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves

I'm way too Black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day

Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like, ""He's Elvis""

But I just wanna design hotels and nail it

Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian

Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?

But I been talkin' to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess He talkin' back
Fuckin' with my clique
[Outro: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fresher than my ma'fuckin' clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique

And all these bad bitches, man, they want the-
They want the- they want the-

The love that's in between the lines, boy, look into my eyes

While I'm grindin' on you (Oh), this is beyond sex (Oh)
I'm high on you (Oh), if it's real, then you know how I feel (Oh)
Rockin' on you, babe, rockin', rockin' on you, babe
Swirlin' on you, babe, in my mind, all I can think about
Is a frame for our future and the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last, oh, woah

You won't find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out till three
You won't ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
You won't find him tryna chase the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go

And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic

And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe

Before they turn the lights out

And I'm crashin' into you
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)

You can turn my lights out

We don't have forever
Ooh, baby, daylight's wastin'

You better kiss me
Before our time has run out
Mmm, yeah, yeah
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing, oh
Oh, baby, take me, me
Before they turn the lights out
Before our time has run out
Baby, love me lights out

Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
Come again?

If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
'Cause you got me face down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And don't take this personal

But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts, I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
You said that you would come again

You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up?
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Please don't take this personal

But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
'Til I made you so
You better act like you know

Everybody's like ""He's no item""
""Please don't like him""
""He don't wife 'em""
""He one nights 'em""

I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
Then tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
(God damn) God damn, baby, my mind's blown
Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And, yeah, I know what you did
But, baby, I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind of shit

If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just
[Bridge]
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same


[Outro]
And though I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
I still want you (Oh)
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I, but I love you
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you

Let yo booty do that yoga

[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe]
Party at the beach down in Copacabana

Sipping Killepitsch, got my black yoga pants on

Me and Brittany, we’ve been down in Atlanta

Sweating in the club, call me Dirty Diana

Flexing like a yogi, drop it down with your hands up

Do a handstand, bend it back, put your legs up

I ain’t got no worries, I’m my own private dancer
My own private dancer


[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
I wanna last, wanna last forever

I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever

I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let your booty do that yoga
Flex it (yoga)
Flex it (yoga)
[Verse 2: Janelle Monáe]
Crown on my head, but the world on my shoulder

I'm too much a rebel, never do what I’m supposed ta

Bend it never break it, baby watch and I’ma show ya

Stretching on my cash, got my money doing yoga

Sometimes I'm PG, and sometimes I'm vulgar

Even when I’m sleeping, I got one eye open

You cannot police me, so get off my areola
Get off my areola


[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
I wanna last, wanna last forever

I wanna dance, wanna dance all night

I wanna last, wanna last forever

I wanna dance, dance, dance all night


[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let your booty do that yoga
Flex it (yoga)
Flex it (yoga)


[Verse 3: Jidenna]
I said yoga, she did that yoga
Looking for my loafers, man I woke up in a toga

She left my collar on like she my owner
So when she downward dog, I jump up on her

I lo-lo-love the way you bend
Oh Lord, I’d love to break you in
Oh Lord, I’d stretch you out and in

Oh Lord, now you should tell a friend
Oh Lord, I pray, pray, I pray they come, come, come on over
And let they bum-bum do that yoga
[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever

I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone, I played on my own
I survived

Hey, I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived


[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket
To a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies

And you're taught to cry in your pillow
But I survived


[Chorus]
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive


[Verse 2]
I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind

I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine
[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket
To a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies

And you're taught to cry in your pillow
But I survived

I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

I'm alive, I'm alive

You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing


[Bridge]
I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted, I went out and got it
I did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you
[Chorus]
And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

I'm alive

Had to pull up on the block cause today I get to whip

And you know my top drop and my car’s name is nae-nae

Had to hit the Quan cause today is a good day

Nah, let me keep going
Show you how I lean, then dab
Nice shoes, car clean cause it’s sunny outside
That mean I pull up with my top down

I don’t have a top now
Mama told me never leave the house without my nightgown
Mama I’m on BET so I can act hyped now
On 'em like the WWE and lay the smackdown
That’s a lot to handle, how could he manage?
Mr. Hit the Quan went viral, gigantic
Hold up wait face it, go ahead pump your brakes fast
Always used to dodge cops, riding around with no plate tags
But they can never catch me, driving like a taxi

Waiting on my taxes, lights camera action
Finna play Michael Jackson, Oprah's in a jacket
Take it but I'll match it, y’all not in my bracket
It’s iHeart Memphis but I also love dabbing
I done took off on em, I feel like a pilot
I done took off on em, I don’t care bout the mileage

I’m so VIP all I know is private
I’ll take the steak, the strip, and the salad
Cause growing up in Memphis, Tennessee I couldn’t have it
Now come correct

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless

How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king

Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets

Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets

Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down

Me sing se

And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware

If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?

Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human

Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad

If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?

Walk in the mall with my new bitch
Tell her to get the whole rack

My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch
Then pull me a new bitch
See that is a snowball effect

I got gold on my neck
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck

Every path I make, every road leads back

To the place I know where I cannot go

If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

Everything is by design

I know everybody on this island has a role, on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I'll be satisfied if I play along

But the voice inside sings a different song

What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding

But no one knows how deep it goes

And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me

And let me know
What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep ('Sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (If you can believe)
Mm, you're such a dream to me


[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh), wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me


[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
""Excuse me, um, I love you""

I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch 'em other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you

Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)

You're like, ""I love you—,"" who starts a conversation like that? Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you

I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself

Is this real? (Is this real?)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh, no), wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mm, boy


[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, ""What happened? Why you?""
But when I see you in my dreams, shh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it

You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)

The Good Housekeeping Seal

(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)

I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple

What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel

What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it (Ooh, hey)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No, I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (Does this end?)
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me
To me, mm, boy, to me

Ooh, bunny hop, bunny hop, drop, pop
Cross your legs, turn around and clap
Shuffle to the left, let's glide now
Ooh, drop it down, drop it down low, low
Low, low, low to the floor, floor
Bring it up, clap, then roll, roll
Step on 'em, step on 'em, step on 'em, step
Step on 'em, kick on 'em, stomp, then you step
Swag the right, surf the left

Work the middle 'til it hurt a little

I can smell a bitch nigga a mile away
Type of nigga so bitch, he should put ""bitch-made"" on his license plate (Bitch!)
From that real shit you bitch niggas play hide and seek (Bitch-ass niggas)

You got fear in your heart so you cooperate (Bitch)

I can't stand how bitch niggas operate
You's a bitch (Bitch), your mama know you a bitch (Bitch)
Your girl even know you a bitch (Bitch)
I don’t know how she suck your dick, pause

Bitch nigga, you should bleed for seven days
No testosterone, you scared to catch a fade

You ran off, so next time I see you, I’ll knock you out on sight

(Bing, bing, bing) Ayy, I don't want no rap beef

'Cause everything I pass puts you back in it
Yeah, we're done, movin' on
But you can't be too far gone

'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you

Everybody knows why I'm here, and you ain't around
'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town

I guess I could leave, I could run from the past
And from us, and from you

If you're movin' on or you're stuck like me

I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself

And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard

Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for

Know it's hard but we need each other

Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast

Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

[Pre-Chorus: bearface]
But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you, I want you

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me

Know it's hard but we need each other

Uh, 뭔가 놓친듯해
커피 한 모금으로 불안함을 해소
An endless rest
내게 갑자기 다가온 불편한 행복
24 hours 시간 참 많아
하루 종일 잠자도 지금은 no problem
몸 부서져라 뭘 해야 할 거 같은데
마냥 삼시 세끼 다 먹는 나란 새끼
내 죄, 쉬는 내 자신을 물어뜯는 개
Don't do that 외쳐봐도 성과에 목매 매일
E'r'yday do my thang, damn if I fail

이 유리 같은 병이 때리지 니 머리

병든 게 세상인지 난지 헷갈려
안경을 벗어도 어둠은 안 흐릿해져
이 시간 뒤에 어떤 라벨이 붙건
부디 그게 전부 너길 바래
너의 너, 너
[Verse 3: SUGA]
다들 병들이 많아 내가 헷갈리는 건
인간이란 본디 추악함을 가진다는 것
마음의 병의 가짓수들만 400개가 더
되는데 해당 안 되는 자 거 별로 없단 것
Yo 병든 게 세상인지 나인지
단순히 바라보는 해석들의 차인지
그게 다인지

Botella tras botella ando tomando pa' olvidarme de ella (Pa' olvidarme de ella)
De ella, de ella nomás hablo en todas mis pedas (En todas mis pedas)
A mis compas bien hartos traigo ya (Jajai)

Pa' ser sinceros, yo ni quiero
Mejor su recuerdo me lo bebo
Los tragos me saben mejor así

[Verso: Gera MX & Christian Nodal, Ambos]
Estaba pensando en llamarte, yo te miro por todas partes
Pero ya no nos vemos, puede que lo olvidemos
Dos tragos y vuelvo a pensarte
Me aferro, no quiero olvidarte
Sentimientos ajenos, los celos no son buenos
Y si me llamas contesto, aunque nunca va a pasar eso
(Aunque nunca va a pasar eso)
Ya mejor ni te molesto, porque sé que vuelvo a joderlo
(Ahuevo que vuelvo a joderlo)
Y ahora que ando tomando bebida me siento triste, ya va a amanecer
A vece' borracho las penas se olvidan, pero nunca te dejé de querer
Fui mal partido, querida, todas mis pedas marcándote al cel
Le puse sal a la herida, cómo quisiera volver al ayer

Don't try to jail my thoughts and think precincts

Don't have to see you to touch you

Dos oruguitas enamoradas
Pasan sus noches y madrugadas
Llenas de hambre, siguen andando
Y navegando un mundo
Que cambia y sigue cambiando
Navegando un mundo
Que cambia y sigue cambiando

Dos oruguitas paran el viento
Mientras se abrazan con sentimiento
Siguen creciendo, no saben cuándo
Buscar algún rincón
El tiempo sigue cambiando
Inseparables son
El tiempo sigue cambiando

Ay, oruguitas, no se aguanten más
Hay que crecer aparte y volver, hacia adelante seguirás
Vienen milagros, vienen crisálidas
Hay quе partir y construir su propio futuro

Hay que crеcer aparte y volver, hacia adelante seguirás
Vienen milagros, vienen crisálidas
Hay que partir y construir su propio futuro

Con sueños nuevos ya solo falta

On my soul, I believe in Lil Crix

And I hate I had fell out with Wiz
You did what you did, so I did what I did

I don't lie, but I steal and I kill
I wish I could stop poppin' these pills
Hit his head and it drop on the wheel
Fresh out of juvie I got me a deal
Told my son I won't let no one kill me
'Cause I promised to take him to Disney
It's a must I keep clutchin' this semi
Show in the O, but my room in Kissimmee

I know everybody tell her I'm silly
But I hope that she see the best in me
Think she feelin' the kid like I'm Gillie

Like she feelin' the kid, like I'm yeah
I'ma snipe, anybody get touched
If it's pressure, I'm stretchin' you out
Last night we was vibin' so tough

On a island, you wake up my wife
Hopefully, I can stop livin' shiesty

Nuski stayed downstairs, the first floor under Granny crib

The streets gon' be the streets, for sure, I know she hate me still
Blame my cousin, nights is cool, she lost her mama, she a lady, still
Granny got Alzheimer's, but I can't forget how she kept it real
(TouchofTrent be wylin' with it)
And now she made it good (Made it good)
Before the opps, we was fightin' niggas inside the neighborhood
Water bill was high as hell, I went next door to fill the jug
Laundromat was packed, I had to grab the soap and fill a tub
Three bedroom, it was eight people who lived with us
I hated school but my granny made me
I couldn't disrespect her 'cause my granny raised me
The funeral home, they know me personally 'cause I gave 'em payments
The police department, they know you personally 'cause you gave 'em statements
I was seventeen, I was tryna take lil' Law case for him

Daddy was doin' life, I couldn't sit outside and wait for him

School sports, I couldn't really attend 'cause I couldn't pay for 'em
See my Auntie Mil do it on her own, that's why I pray for her
And I barely talked to my uncle, I'm talkin' 'bout my mama brothers
And my daddy brother wasn't here for us, but I still love him
And I love you, the only time I hurt you if you steal from me
I hate the way that lil' bruh died, that's why I feel for him
Yeah, them niggas know how shit'll end every time they play with Varney

Took time for my first offense, I ain't have a paid attorney
That's why I ain't never really pay attention every time they say they love me
And I was blind to the fact my mama said they was never for me

Like, how you gon' tell me you broke when I seen you play wit' money?
They counted me out, they ain't even give a fuck, but I still love 'em
Can you tell my sister I got her back? I still love, love you
The way you say that shit on the keyboard, you gotta say it in public
I'm most hated, huh? But what you hate me for?
You ain't even got no real reason, 'cause I ain't gave you none
I kept my mouth closed for the same hoes tryna give me some'

Can someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen

How you bring a knife to a gunfight?
They gon' always do it twice when it's done right
I remember ridin' 'round 'til the sunlight come up
I ain't tryna argue so I hung up
D-boy fresh with it on me, know how I pop out
If bullshit is not important, what I'm gon' lie 'bout?
Don't play with Baby, I give you somethin' to cry 'bout
That's a dime, that's for you and four of your friends to fly out
Every time we outside, that shit be goin' up
I got women tryna get at me like you been growin' up
Really, I know you see what's happenin', I'm steady blowin' up
I know niggas want me to fall but I'm steady goin' uphill
Started from the bottom, how the fuck I'm up here?
If you rеally came from nothin', then you know how that feel
Ain't no extras, only stеppers, that's the way that I live
Put some extras on it, blessed it, nigga, that's what I did
Heart cold frozen, got my mindset on where on however this shit go
Still kinda nervous hopin' nobody would notice it
At the point, I met you, slowed me down
You fuckin' up my focus, bro, I'm really on some more shit
Ain't been on the scene that much, I'm somewhere gettin' loaded
Ain't talkin' 'bout weed that I smoked or lean that I po'd
I'm talkin' 'bout this money I'm savin' up, I been in the tuck
Fuckin' with me, winin' the lottery, ayy, who feelin' lucky?
Know some real ones ready to slide with me if I press the button
People who done really been down from me, they don't ask for nothin'
Keepin' it one million, I'm too real to say that I'm one hundred
You are not the one 'cause you got money, real shit

I don't know what they told you, but you got me fucked up
You see how we walked in? You can't see we run stuff?
I gotta think out the box, I hate bein' bunched up
Glad that I been through a lot, it made me a monster
I done seen this shit get grimy, I can't have no conscience
See 'em tryna clone me and all, but it's only one me
If I came in this world alone, why I get lonely?
Can someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen

[Verse 2]
I don't feel a lot of this shit, I can't even hold you
Catch me in the Hamptons with Mike Rubin or HOV them

Or catch me in the hood with a Lamborghini with the doors up
I can't even lie, it broke my heart, I heard you told some
Gotta keep my fire under my jacket, it's a cold world
She with me when he go out to practice, this a cold girl
She a goblin, she don't even stop it, make your toes curl
Bae, I'm sorry for puttin' our business out there
You too cool for a loser, you could be winnin' out here
You keep it wet, I'm gon' invest, support yo' swimmin' line
Don't worry 'bout that, just do yo' best, I promise you'll be fine
You let that shit come out yo' mouth, now you can't press rewind, it's stuck there
Five million cash, all blues, you get a rush, yeah
I don't need a nigga or a bitch, who the fuck cares?
You the one that's really sour, I ain't even gon' go there
You was 'posed to be here, but oh well
[Chorus]
I don't know what they told you, but you got me fucked up
You see how we walked in? You can't see we run stuff?
I gotta think out the box, I hate bein' bunched up
Glad that I been through a lot, it made me a monster

Eyes on you when you perform

Label whores can't clock, I'm so obscure

Masterpiece, genius
Drip intravenous

Patty cake on that wrist
Tiffany Blue billboards over that ceiling (Unique)
We don't like plain

Always dreamed of paper planes

Mile-high when I rodeo
Then I come down and take off again (Unique)
You see pleasure in my glare
Look over my shoulder and you ain't scared
The effects you have on me when you stare
Head on a pillow, hike it in the air

I'm too classy for this world, forever, I'm that girl

Feed you diamonds and pearls, ooh, baby

I'm too classy to be touched, I paid them all in dust

I'm stingy with my love, ooh, baby

I got pearls beneath my legs, my lips, my hands, my hips

Can't find an ocean deep that can compete with this cinnamon kiss (U-N-I-Q-U-E)

Run down with my vest on, no such thing as being too cautious

I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

With a note sayin', ""I love you,"" I meant it

A girl undercover, but you tore her apart
Maybe this year, maybe this year
I'll give it to someone special

Él te ama, te adora, lo da todo por ti

A ti te gusta lo malo, irte a fuego conmigo, woh-oh
El pelo te jalo, estoy que te bendigo
Aunque tú ere' pecado, eh, voy pa'l infierno si sigo
Detrás de ese culote, ya voy de camino

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Hoy yo voy a buscarte después de las doce
Ya te quiero comer y repetir toa' las pose'
Hay que disimular y hacer que no me conoce'
Pasa el día con él, yo soy tu gato de noche
Hoy yo voy a buscarte después de las doce
Ya te quiero comer y repetir toa' las pose'
Hay que disimular y hacer que no me conoce'
Pasa el día con él, yo soy tu gato de noche

Canto 'e bellaca, ese toto vo'a martillarte (Jajajajaja)
En el Can-Am voy a buscarte (Real G)
Ponte en cuatro goma', que ese culo vo'a chuparte (Plo, plo, plo)
Loco por venirme, pero voy a esperar a que te vengas primero tú, sí (Jajajaja)
Tú ere' una hijueputa, te gustan los bandolero' (Bandolero)
Loca con mi bicho y loca con hacer dinero
Esto es Real G4 Life (Foreva) y estás escuchando el verdadero
Jajajajaja (Baby)
Calla'o, que nadie se ha entera'o (En el tintea'o)
Ese culote está altera'o (Y ninguno lo ha toca'o)
Yo no creo en el amor y me tiene enamora'o (Yah-ah)

Tú ere' mi loca y hoy te toca la terapia
Si no se lo meto le da rabia
Puedo tener más de veinte
Pero tú ere' mi bichota, tú ere' mi sicaria
Tanto' pece' en el mar
Y yo contigo en la pecera, pudiendo estar con cualquiera
Anoche fue champán adentro de la bañera
Hoy son cuatro botellas de vino y a la tercera se vino
Si ese cabrón te pregunta, dile que fue el destino
Que te puso en cuatro y bien suelta al frente mío
Mi bicho no tiene miedo, pero se pasa escondío'
Dentro de ti
Dije que no volvía, pero mentí
Se lo puse a otra y me arrepentí
Porque no se sintió lo que contigo sentí, eh-eh-eh

[Verso]
¿Qué será?
Tal vez la noche como de costumbre amanecerá
Sigo pensando en tus gestos cuando se me cruza otra
Pero es lo que hay, ¿Y qué más da?
Quiero olvidar, se va a lograr

[Pre-Coro]
El dolor poco a poco se fue borrando
Tú y yo, nuestra historia se ha terminado
Yo sé, fue por bien de los dos
Tal vez el amor se acabó
No sé qué fue lo que pasó
Pero al chile, sí me dolió

[Coro]
Bye
Mejor sigue tu camino
Mientras fumo y tomo vino
Que estar contigo ya no me convino
Bye
Y ya me da igual, que la neta
Me distraigo con princesas
Y a mí tus besos ya no me interesan
[Post-Coro]
¡Bye!

Ahí te va, chiquita

El dolor poco a poco se fue borrando
Tú y yo, nuestras almas se abandonaron
Yo sé, fue por bien de los dos
Tal vez el amor se acabó
Tal vez seguimos en calor
Tal vez a mí no me ayudó

Bye

It's deeper than rap and this life can get crazy


[Verse 1]
Off the porch and didn't know where to go (Where to go)
Cross the street with my dawg, yeah, the woe' (The woe')
Being me made it harder to grow
Still went up, got my feet off the floor (Off the floor)

Gunna Wunna been wavy (Gunna Wunna been wavy)
But I always been playing it low (Playing it low)
Gettin' that work on the daily (Getting work on the daily)
Got a M and went crazy (Got a M and went crazy)
Then I went, moved my mom out the shady
Went and bought a Mercedes (Mercedes)
Took a L, niggas thinking it's gravy
Niggas gotta be crazy (Gotta be crazy)

Popping out, they gon' see me in HD

Give a reason to hate me (Reason to hate me)
Me, your bitch and her friend, that's a cool three
I can give 'em three reasons to hate me
I care less that they talking, fearless, I pull off in a yacht like it don't even phase me (Phase me)
I been talking to my accountant a lot, tryna make what I got stack tall like KD

Niggas talking 'bout who calling the shots, bitches calling my phone talking they want a baby
Shit get tragic, but we still make it happen, it's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy


[Chorus]
All this money, I'm going crazy
All these bitches, I'm going crazy
Missed some millions, I'm going crazy
All these killers, I'm going crazy (Crazy)
It's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy (Crazy)
It's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy
Spending them racks, go crazy (Crazy)
Make it right back, that's crazy (That's crazy)
All these Benjamins, I'ma go crazy (That's crazy)
Getting it in, my numbers look crazy (Crazy)
It's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy (Crazy)
It's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy
[Verse 2]
Is it true, boy, you reap what you sow?
If you fast, if you know, then you know

When I pray, got my knees on the floor (Pray)
To The High even when I feel low (High)
Ride or die, forever, I hope (Hope)
Even when shit get crazy (When shit get crazy)
Geekin' up, 'bout to stop being sober
Livin' every day faded (Livin' every day faded)
Think I got me a dime, bottom bitch do whatever I tell her whenever I say it (Whenever I say it)
Come to find out her P stand for pussy and she give it to any player that's paying (Paying)

I can dig it, but not for no made man, that's too slow, that lil' money won't phase me
Like you keep pulling folks out the ditch that won't give you back shit and you know that it's crazy
I'm with brother, he helped me get that chip off my shoulder, he told me can't nobody save me
We done traveled, we come save the world, looking out for the girls and took care of the babies
I done took some real losses and losses, I'm sticking it back, ain't nothing you can say to me
Gunna Wunna just said what it was and you still tryna make this shit up and it's crazy

All this money, I'm going crazy

Missed some millions, I'm going crazy
All these killers, I'm going crazy (Crazy)

It's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy
Spending them racks, go crazy

Viviendo en el San Andrés, pero de a deveras, carros y feria

Tres estrellas me atoraron la clave en caliente, desafanaron

[Verso 1]
Te vi, me viste, al principio fue una broma
Luego la verdad se asoma, ve, intercambiamos sonrisas
Pasó algún tiempo, poco menos de una hora
Y por debajo de la mesa tu tacón tocó mi bota

[Coro]
Fue más sencillo que hacer la tabla del uno
Y a la hora del desayuno ya sabía que te amaba
A las semanas de iniciar con la aventura
Se nos hizo miel la luna y un concierto pa' Tijuana
Era prohibido, era imposible, pero hicimos lo que se nos dio la gana

[Verso 2]
Después de eso nos veíamos casi a diario
Nuestro amigo el calendario nos dio cuatrocientas citas
De tanto amarnos, nos volvimos dos extraños
No sé quién toma hoy tu mano, ni tú dónde estoy ahorita

Fue más sencillo que hacer la tabla del uno

(Pipe that shit up, TnT)
I tell myself, ""It'll be alright""
Now it's 3 A.M. and I still got no reply

But I spend my nights alone
(Trill got that juice, nigga)
By myself, just another lonely day
Do I need help, because this ache won't go away?
These shadows on my wall, my only curtain call
The crowd goes silent now
Waiting for you

[Verse]
Where you at right now? Let me pull up and let's talk about it
I finally got some time alone and I thought about it
I swear to God your love is war, it's so much I can take
I been thuggin' for so long, bae, give me a break

Late nights, I reminisce about you, it's hard to forget about you

I swear I can't live with you, but I can't live without you
Jump off a plane on an island and I'm here without you
Ain't left my hotel in three days, I feel sick without you, sick without you
My stomach do this turning, I feel sick without you
My closest friend my worst enemy

I'm not okay when we apart, but I pretend to be, I

[Chorus]
I threw the party of the century
And people came over, no one left sober
And it was all for you
It was all for you

I been under this rock for so long
, don't let the world in
Close the door, don't let the world in
Let's go and hide in again
Rekindle our flame and light my fire again
Oh, come light my fire again

Extra panties in your bag and some makeup removers
You know I'm hardly on my own 'cause I stay with a shooter

She call me daddy, she got issues, I am not her father
Hop off the boat, into the jet, leave the yacht at the harbor
She injectin' with Ozempic, tryna stop her hunger

Huh, I wanked before you came so I can fuck you longer
S650, chauffeur driven, just tap your address in
Pack your bags and we can board the next flight, we can check in

Before I fly you out again and you make me regret it (Ooh)
