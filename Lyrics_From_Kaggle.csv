Ghost,Justin Bieber,"Young blood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch on nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that
If I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (more than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
Young blood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that
If I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (yeah)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy (whoa)
I miss you more than life

Whoa-oh-oh

My Ex's Best Friend,Machine Gun Kelly X blackbear,"Ayy
You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah

I read those texts that you sent to yours
But I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say-)
You walked in my life at 2:00 a.m.
'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said
Now we're in the back seat of the black car going home
When she asked me, ""Is it wrong if I come up with you?""
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kissed you for the first time in New York City, uh
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up, and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it
First off, I'm not sorry
I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible
Girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess, and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me
You text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothing to do between you and me
Please, don't say nothing at all
Sounds so true to me
We don't have nothing to say, hey
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up, and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times many ways
Merry Christmas, to you

Haven't Met You Yet,Michael Buble,"I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought, I thought of every possibility
And I know someday that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work, so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet, mmm
I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing, and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life
And I know that we can be so amazing
And, baby, your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility, mmm
And somehow I know that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work, so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, I give so much more than I get, mmm
I just haven't met you yet
They say all's fair
In love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united
And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility, hmm
And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you, kid, I'll give more than I get

Bust A Move,Young M.C.,"This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down 'cause you're overzealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous
Ok, smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
Says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move
Ah, ah, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Ah, ah, yeah (just bust a move!)
Ah, ah, yeah, ah, ah
You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theatre gets dark just to start the show
Then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""hello
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? hey, bust a move!
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it, (just bust a move!)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""no way""
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sophistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move!
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it (just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it (break it down for me fellas)
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, hey, yeah
Ooh, uh, hey, yeah!
Ooh, uh, hey, yeah!
Ooh, uh, uh, uh
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say neato, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now you're feelin really fine 'cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move!
If you want it, you got it, ah
If you want it, baby, you got it (just bust a move), ah
If you want it, you got it, ah
If you want it, baby, you got it (move it, boy)

Monster Mash,"Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett And The Crypt-Kickers","I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
(He did the mash) He did the monster mash
(The monster mash) It was a graveyard smash
(He did the mash) It caught on in a flash
(He did the mash) He did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
(They did the mash) They did the monster mash
(The monster mash) It was a graveyard smash
(They did the mash) It caught on in a flash
(They did the mash) They did the monster mash
The zombies were having fun (tennis shoe, wa hoo)
The party had just begun (tennis shoe, wa hoo)
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula and his son
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'
(They played the mash) They played the monster mash
(The monster mash) It was a graveyard smash
(They played the mash) It caught on in a flash
(They played the mash) They played the monster mash
Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?
(It's now the mash) It's now the monster mash
(The monster mash) And it's a graveyard smash
(It's now the mash) It's caught on in a flash
(It's now the mash) It's now the monster mash
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you
(Then you can mash) Then you can monster mash
(The monster mash) And do my graveyard smash
(Then you can mash) You'll catch on in a flash
(Then you can mash) Then you can monster mash
(Wa hoo, monster mash)
(Wa hoo, monster mash)
Easy Igor, you impetuous young boy (Wa hoo, monster mash)

That's a shame
You could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?

Is more than who we are
You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe

You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no

You won't regret
I must confess, I'm really feelin' you
Anything you've ever wanted before
Is right here for you, for you
Don't worry what they say
Just bring your love away
'Cause your friends can't do what I can for you
I don't wanna hear you say
Baby, tell me yes
Don't tell me no
You'll be sayin' no
When it's really yes
You'll be sayin' no
When it's really yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

The Good Life,OneRepublic,"Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city, near Picadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night
Night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please, tell me
What there's to complain about
When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Hopelessly I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly the hope is we have so much to feel good about
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

The Power Of Love,Celine Dion,"The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your whole body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love
The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

To The Moon And Back,Savage Garden,"She's takin' her time
Making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smile then the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one
They're sayin'
Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection but
Somewhere in a private place
She packs her bag for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kinda pilot to come
(And she'll say to him)
She's sayin'
I'll fly ya to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've gotta ticket for a world where we a-belong
So would you be my baby? Yeah
She can't remember a time
When she felt needed
If love was red, then she was colorblind
All her friends, well, they've been trialed for treason
And crimes that were never defined
She's saying
""Love is like a barren place and
Reaching out for human faith
Is like a Journey I just don't have a map for""
So baby, gonna take a drive and
I push shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging
All her hopes on the stars

Fall In Love,Bailey Zimmerman,"Heard you moved out to South Carolina
Just like you always said we would
Packed your bags in that old 4Runner
That I bought you when things were good
I'm glad to see the stop sign didn't hit ya
Bring you back to your senses
Oh, it waved you gone, goodbye
Yeah, it waved you gone, goodbye
I heard you found yourself a brand new man
Put a rock on your finger
And he vowed you a second chance
Built a house right by the coast
That ocean view is beautiful
But baby, I just want you to know
He don't know you like I did
Well money talks, but I ain't buying
'Cause love's a smoke ring
Wrapped around your finger
One second it's a blessing
And the next it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walking testimony
My confession is a lesson
That I'm pouring out in this song
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh-whoa-whoa
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh-whoa-whoa
You don't wanna fall in love
I seen your mama walking out the county market
And I thought to ask her how she's been
She said she's missing ya
And tried to go convincing ya
Not to settle down with him
She ain't wrong, the whole town knows it
You had a bed of roses
But girl, you couldn't walk that line
You can act like you're doin' fine
'Cause love's a smoke ring
Wrapped around your finger
One second it's a blessing
And the next it's already gone

"Because You Loved Me (From ""Up Close & Personal"")",Celine Dion,"For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through
Through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me
Ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me, oh
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
The light in the dark shining your love in to my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

Sukiyaki,4:00 PM,"It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day
And I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely
Untouchable memories, seem to keep haunting me
Another love so true
That once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
And I'm wishing you were here with me
Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, I just don't know what to do
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine once again
You'd be mine all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me
Girl, I don't know what I did
To make you leave me but what I do know
Is that since you've been gone
There's such an emptiness inside
I'm wishing you'd come back to me
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine once again
You'd be mine all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me
Oh, baby, you took your love away from me"
"Baby, Come To Me",Patti Austin A Duet With James Ingram,"Thinking back in time
When love was only in the mind
I realize
Ain't no second chance
You got to hold onto romance
Don't let it slide
There's a special kinda magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share
Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you every day
Gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to living without you
Spending every dime
To keep you talking on the line
That's how it was
And all those walks together
Out in any kind of weather
Just because
There's a brand new way of looking at your life
When you know that love is standing by your side
Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to living without you
The night can be cold
There's a chill to every evening when you're all alone
Don't talk anymore
'Cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm
Oh, darling keep me warm
Baby, come to me (come to me)
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you every day

South Side,Moby Featuring Gwen Stefani,"See myself in the pouring home
See the light, come over now
I see myself in the pouring rain
I watch hope come over me
Here we are now, going to the east side
I pick up my friends and we start to ride
Ride all night and we ride all day
Some may come, no but some may stay
Here we are in the pouring home
I watch the light man fall the comb
I watch a light move across the screen
I watch the light come over me
Here we are now going to the west side
Weapons in hand as we go for a ride
Some may come, no but some may stay
Watching out for a sunny day
Where there's love and darkness
And my sidearm
Hey, Elan, Elan
Here we are now going to the north side
I look at my friends as they start to ride
Ride at night, yeah we ride all day
Looking out for a sunny day
Here we are now going to the south side - to the south side
I pick up my friends and we hope we won't die - hope we won't die
Ride at night, ride through heaven and hell - heaven and hell
Come back, love, and feel so well - feel so well"

We miss you on your side of the bed, mm-mm

And they stare at me like souvenir
Don't wanna let you out my head

Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside, like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

It Ain't Me,Kygo x Selena Gomez,"It Ain't Me
Song by
Kygo, Selena Gomez
I had a dream we were sippin' whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery, nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines we stopped seein' eye to eye
You were stayin' out all night and I had enough
No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home, and you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's wakin' up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
It ain't me
I had a dream, we were back to 17
Summer nights and The Libertines, never growin' up
I'll take with me the Polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's wakin' up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
It ain't me, no, no
It ain't me, no, no

And such a strange land?
If you'd come today
You could have reached a whole nation

"Stay (I Missed You) (From ""Reality Bites"")",Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories,"you say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time, so
And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah, yeah, I missed you
And you say I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard
Don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
To anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no, no, no
So I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song
Lover's in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weep for the
Other who was dying since the day they were born
Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown
And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take me anyhow or anywhere with you
You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, 'Hey, I can leave, I can leave'
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah, I miss you
You said you caught you 'cause you
Want me and one day you'll let me go
You'll try to give away a keeper or keep me
'Cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say, 'Stay'
You say I only hear what I want to"

Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
Without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you
Oh, oh, oh

It's All Coming Back To Me Now,Celine Dion,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed if just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust, and I just knew my eyes were drying up
Forever (forever)
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
But when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that
I just have to admit that it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this, and I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe, but it's all coming back to me
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold, and there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again, but then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure, it was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby
If I kiss you like this, and if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago, but it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this, and if you need me like that
It was dead long ago, but it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist, and it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me, I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last, we'd count up all the chances that were lost to us
Forever (forever)

There were things we'd never do again, but then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure, it was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby
When you touch me like this, and when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind, but it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this, and when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see, all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies, all coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now
If you forgive me all this, if I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget, and it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this, and when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see, all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies, all coming back to me

It changes everything
They say it's a blessing
They say it's a gift
They say it's a miracle and I believe that it is
It conquers all
But it's a mystery
Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And it fades away
So easily
In this world we've created
In this place that we live
In the blink of an eye babe, the darkness slips in
Love lights the world
Unites the lovers for eternity
Love breaks the chains
Love aches for every one of us
Love takes the tears and the pain
And then turns it into the beauty that remains
Look at this place
It was paradise
But now it's dying
I'll pray for love
I'll take, my chances that it's not too late
Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And it fades away
So easily
And it fades away so easily

That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me, she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back like
I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, goin' HAM in a rental
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (lil' biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah I know that karma's too real so I hope you doin' cool
But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass, I ain't fuckin with
I ain't fuckin', I ain't I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you"
"Last Night (From ""The Nutty Professor"")",Az Yet,"Last night, you were so into it
You told me secrets that you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and, yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine as you taste mine
I kissed your lips, you felt my body slip into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the rivers
I saw Heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and so very innocent
We talked of memories, our favourite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night, right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight in your soul
You felt incredible, I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the rivers
I saw Heaven when I made sweet love to you
(Sunlight) sunlight, red, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
(Moonlight) moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes, and I'm so, I'm so in love
Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains and the rivers
I saw Heaven when I made sweet love to you, baby
Last night, I was inside of you
Last night, while making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the rivers
I saw Heaven when I made sweet love to you

Your Love Is My Drug,Ke$ha,"Maybe I need some rehab, or maybe just need some sleep
I've got a sick obsession, I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley, I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping, hitting my head against the wall
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Won't listen to any advice, mom's telling me I should think twice
But left to my own devices I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected if I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead
What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time (all the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried

I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave
Hey, so I gotta question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug?
Your drug, huh, your drug
Huh, your drug is my love, your drug?
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Wild Thing,Tone-Loc,"Let's do it
Workin' all week, 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street, I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye, she got into the ride, went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc, she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll, and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel, she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean
And let us do the wild thing""
Wild thing
Wild thing
Shoppin' at the mall, looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl, she cold rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night?""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well, I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house, one thing led to another
A key in the door, I cold hit the floor, looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say, I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two, I was once like you
And I liked to do the wild thing""
Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please, baby, baby please
Posse in effect, hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig
I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame, I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss cold gave me a kiss, and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine, still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock, she was like static cling
But that's what happens when bodies start slappin'
From doin' the wild thing
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please, baby, baby please
Wild thing
Doin' a little show, at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock, so I say what the heck
She wanted to come on stage, and do her little dance
So I said chill for now, but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished, I took her around the way
And what do you know, she was good to go, without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler - I get paid to do the wild thing""
Say what?!
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista, baby

Listen To Your Heart,D.H.T.,"I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea
You've built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye
And there are voices
That want to be heard
So much to mention
But you can't find the words
The scent of magic
The beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye
Listen to your heart, mmm, mmmmmm
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why

But being without you just ain't livin', ain't livin'at all

Heart And Soul,T'Pau,"Something in the moonlight catches my eye
The shadow of a lover goes dancing by
Looking for a little bit of love to grow, so
Give me love, give me heart and soul
You never let me cross to the other side now
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Hard on the heels of something more
But I lost your love, heart and soul
The tear in my heart (more than an ocean)
As you walk on by
I feel so low and your head is high
Everything you do
Convinces me more (keeps us apart)
Please, give me love, give me heart and soul
Looking to the day when I saw your face
(I feel a tearing in half of my heart)
I wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race
You moved in a way that I've known before
Now I want your love, heart and soul
Tired eyes, tears that dried (Leaving you ain't easy now)
On the bed, on the pillow (Loving you's the harder part)
Where the love has died
A turn of the key (you never want me for myself)
Through the door you go
Don't look back (now I've needed you)
(Right from the very start)
To hurt me more
Everything you said was to the point
Can't you try to (oh won't you even try to)
Give a little bit of heart and soul
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul
And don't you make me
Beg for more (must I beg you?)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit of heart and soul
Walking on the water
Walking on the air (a walk on the water)
That was the heart of the love we shared
Do you keep secret left untold (is all that I need)
But you can't give love, heart or soul
I used to have a lover (but miracles are not happening)
With a Midas touch
I turned to gold, but he turned to dust
Left me for another, I turned to stone
Now give me love, heart and soul
Tired eyes, tears that dried (living in a fantasy)
On the bed, on the pillow
Where you told your lies (there's never any room to breathe)
A turn of the key (hoping every waking hour)
My blood runs cold
Don't look back (you'll turn around)
To hurt me more (and say that we can start)
Everything you did just said it all
Can't you try to (oh won't you even try to)
Give a little bit of heart and soul
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul
And don't you make me
Beg for more (must I beg you?)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit of heart and soul
Somehow, I lost my way
Looking to see something in your eyes
But love will never compromise
Now this is the politics of life, yeah
Give a little bit of heart and soul
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul
And don't you make me beg for more
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit, a little bit
Give a little bit of heart and soul
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul
And don't you make me
Beg for more (must I beg you?)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit, a little bit
Give a little bit of heart and soul
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul
And don't you make me beg for more
Give a sign, I need to know, oh
Give a little bit of heart and soul
Give a little bit"

The Lover In Me,Sheena Easton,"Talk about the love you're missing
Maybe then it's true when they say love is blind
I can help you if you listen
I can make you feel good if you just let me try

But I gotta know that you're there to receive

But I gotta feel that I'm all that you need
I'll be your everything and I can give you so much more
And I'll never leave you lonely at night

Beggin',Maneskin,"Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
Riding high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, but you warned me then
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end
So, any time I bleed, you let me go
Yeah, any time I feed you, get me? No?
Any time I seek, you let me know
But I plan and see, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'

And put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out, darling
I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hanging over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul
What we doing? What we chasing?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture telling where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had, and you took the pay
But I keep walking on, keep opening doors
Keep hoping for, that the door is yours
Keep oh-so home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm beggin'
Mhm, ye-e-e-ah
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm 'bout to fade to black
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling

Sweet Child O' Mine,Guns N' Roses,"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Kiss On My List,Daryl Hall John Oates,"My friends wonder why I call you all the time, what can I say?
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, no, I know I'm right, alright
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice
When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they wanna know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list
Of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss, I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss
When I turn out the light
I go crazy wondering what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time? 'Cause it means more to me
Sometimes, I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want, I want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on
But if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you wanna know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list

Where Does My Heart Beat Now,Celine Dion,"So much to believe in
We were lost in time
Everything I needed
I fell into your eyes
Always thought of keepin'
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave
Without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
Candle in the water
Drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger
Of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
I need someone to give my heart to
I feel it getting stronger and stronger
And stronger
And I feel inside
Hearts are made to last

Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me

Islands In The Stream,Kenny Rogers Duet With Dolly Parton,"Baby, when I met you, there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh-huh
Making love with each other, uh-huh
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, uh-huh
From one lover to another, uh-huh
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, uh-huh
Making love with each other, uh-huh
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, uh-huh
From one lover to another, uh-huh
Sail away
Oh come sail away with me

No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, uh-huh
From one lover to another, uh-huh

I told you that
We out on the road with my people
Just doin' what I gotta do
There's nothing goin' on that shouldn't be goin' on
You gotta trust me, Ma
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think
She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of
One day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized I got
Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on

So controlling, you say that you love me
But you don't
Your family told me one day
I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me

Drove me away then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming

Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs

Superwoman Pt. II,Lil' Mo Featuring Fabolous,"[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I guess I ain't got no reason to mingle 'round
I found a superwoman
That can leap from the truck in a single bound
Mami I'm tryna bling you down
So niggas without shades on
Can't stare when I bring you 'round
She put her lips on the weed
And pull it to work her tongue
And make me cum faster than a speeding bullet
Her love's stronger than a locomotive
But only for the F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
Sing to me ma

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
Baby they can't play you
Cause I'll save you with my superpowers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your superwoman

[Verse 2: Lil' Mo]
They don't make any girls like me, no, no
Take a girl like to me to get
A guy like you to understand how girls ain't the same

Cause they can't do it like this
I've been sent to save your day

But you know I care for you
And anytime this nigga's there for you
This feelings I only share for you
This makes it a little more clear for you that...

How much more will I have to pay
Why can't you think it over
Why can't you forget about the past

Why can't you forget the past
When love makes this sound, babe
A heart needs a second chance
Don't put me down, babe
Can't you see I love you
Since you've been gone, I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over, I just can't say goodbye
I never loved her, I never needed her
She was willing and that's all there is to say
Don't forsake me, please, don't leave me now
A heart needs a second chance
Yeah, you've been gone and I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over, I just can't say goodbye
Please, forgive me and forget it
I was wrong and I admit it
Why can't we talk it over
Why can't we forget about
Forget about the past
A heart needs a second chance
When love makes this sound, babe
A heart needs a second chance
Don't put me down, babe
You been gone, I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over, I just can't say goodbye

Diane's a debutante, backseat of Jacky's car
Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap, he's got his hand between her knees
Jacky say, ""Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks slacks, now do what I please""

Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
They say, oh yeah, life goes on

Scratches his head and does his best James Dean

Can you run to these open arms
When no one else understands
Can we tell God and the whole world

"Wildflower',","Skylark',","She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times, her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence in her ears
Let her cry, for she's a lady (she's a lady)
Let her dream, for she's a child (child)
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
And if by chance I should hold her (if by chance that I should hold her)
Let me hold her for a time (let me hold her for a time)
But if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden to be mine (I would pick her from the garden to be mine)
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Be careful how you touch her, for she'll awaken
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always payin' for a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows
That only she can hear, and so she goes
Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
Let her cry, for she's a lady (she's a lady)
Let her dream, for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
She's a flower growing wild
She's free"
"Last Kiss',","J. Frank Wilson and The Cavaliers',","Well, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The crying tires the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last
Well, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
Well, when I woke up, the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running in my eyes
But I found my baby somehow that night
I raised her head and when she smiled and said
Hold me darling for a little while
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night
Well, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world"

Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city, baby, you can't ignore it

First time I caught her shit, she aint even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat you, baby, I'm liable to fuck up your whole life
I got her trained, now she suck me with ice

Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bo-legged and bend the corner
She proud to be fuckin' me, 'cause I'm stuntin' on 'em
It feel good to be fuckin' a real nigga don't'uh?
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin' her off, 'cause she ain't with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin', 'cause I done beat her under
Baby snatchin', not now, I'm tellin' ya, I promise
I exposed her to real and now she hate lame
'Member she used to run from me, now she like pain
She call me sometimes just ask me is it her thing
